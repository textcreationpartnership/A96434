            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Again; If any take offence that I preface this Treatiſe with Three Hnourable Names, one of which would have been an honour to a more polite and elaborate Diſcourſe: my Anſwer is this; When I had deſigned this Piece unto the Preſs, I knew none, whoſe Experiences could more fully comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subject treated on, then your ſelves: Your Preſervations have been many and ſignal, at home, abroad, by land, by water; few perſons have had ſuch remarkable Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, as you have had, and few Families can inſtance in three Brethren, who can give forth narratives of ſuch notable and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Eſcapes, as you can give: And therefore, ſeing you have equally ſhared in the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Protections of a good God, I am bold to make this Application to you All; in which I do humbly Remember you of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging mercies, that the ſence thereof may be awakened in you; that, like that <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch, you may often read over your Diaries, gather up your memorable preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations;

            <p>I am not aſhamed (Right Worſhipfull) to tell the world how ancient and how affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate a <hi>Moecenas</hi> you have been to me; that I received many encouragements from you, when I was ſtudent in the Univerſitie; how ready I have alwayes found you, to lay forth your power and Intereſt for me: how freely and ſpeedily you placed me at <hi>Ald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winckle,</hi> and how much I have found the favour of a Patron, and the affections of a friend (I might go higher) for the ſpace of many yeares; which is much, conſidering what hard meaſure ſome good Miniſters have found from their Patrons, though good men, in theſe times of difference, both upon a civil and Religious account; and indeed, I think it to be ingenious (whatever others
<pb facs="tcp:151446:6"/>think) and well comporting with the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Miniſter (whileſt the <hi>jus praeſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandi,</hi> by a Law, is veſted in Honourable hands) as to own God in his providential diſpoſure, ſo to acknowledge the favour of man, in that Liberty he obtaines to do his Maſter's work: Sure I am, this was a mercy which ſome godly and gifted Miniſters did long want (whileſt the Epiſcopal Monopoly laſted) and long waited for; yea, after all their waiting, could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without ſnares to their conſcience, obtain.</p>
            <p>If my poor Labours have been anſwered with any ſucceſs from heaven, (as I truſt they have,) in my little Congregation; the people have reaſon (which ſome of them have done) to bleſs God, that your choice, and their call had ſo full a concurrence in one perſon: But, though they ſhould be ſilent, I may not, I cannot; I am under ſuch a ſenſe of obligation, that I am preſſed in ſpirit, to make ſome publick payment of my debt unto you, in a miniſteriall way, (which is a Symony, neither ſinfull before
<pb facs="tcp:151446:7"/>God, nor offenſive to good men): There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Dear Sir, I beg your acceptation of this poor Preſent: Give your Miniſter leave, from the preſs, (wanting opportunity by reaſon of your non-reſidency, not his, to ſpeak often unto you from the Pulpit) to minde you of that great deliverance, you received from the Lord in the Thames; how often the ſentence of Death hath been reverſed, when you have been under painfull and languiſhing diſtempers: in what way of Providence God hath looſened you from the noiſe and vanity of a Court; what Reſpects you have from men, good and great; what ſafety you had in the late War; what bleſſings the Lord hath heaped upon you, in a dear Lady, a numerous and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Progeny: and, in what other wayes of mercy the Lord hath appeared graciouſly unto you; O let all theſe have a kindly work upon your ſpirit, to warme your heart more and more towards God, his waies and people: and let them, by way of holy force, fix your heart, <hi>Joſhua</hi> like, <hi>with your houſe to ſerve the Lord,</hi> that <hi>Jehovah</hi> may ſtill

               <hi>and may come to the grave in a full age, like as a ſhock of corne cometh in his ſeaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My next addreſs is to you, my Lord, your Honour hath <hi>ſeen the work of God, and his wonders in the deep,</hi> you have converſed much with people of <hi>ſtrange Languages;</hi> conteſted with men of fierce and cruel ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: you have been <hi>a man of warre from your youth;</hi> expert in all the ſtages and ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems of a well-ordered battel, you have long ſerved the Intereſt of a forraign Prince and State, where you have not onely been preſerved, but promoted; God hath not onely given you ſafety, but Honour alſo; and though you was a Stranger in Name, Nation, Language, and ſomething in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion alſo, yet God bowed the heart of Prince, Nobles, and others, to give you the reſpect your worth had merited; and now, after Twenty years voluntary Exile, or more, God hath brought you back, with Three Sonnes, to your native ſoil, (immediately
<pb facs="tcp:151446:8"/>after the ſtorme of war was blown over it) and that, after an honourable rate: all which are mercies worth your owning, and are as ſilent Monitors from the Lord, unto you.

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen, with my own people, I thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully owned before the Lord, an eminent Deliverance from an imminent Danger, I then entred uppon this Diſcourſe, which was ſuited to that Providence: And having often reflected upon that ſignall mercy, duely conſidering the opportunities of doing and receiving good, which I have had, ſince that gracious reprieve from death, I have ſince drawn up my Meditations, which then were ſhort, ſuddain and confuſed, into a more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, orderly, and methodicall Treatiſe: I do not covet the applauſe, of men, nor court your Acceptance with ſtrains of wit, an affected Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, new lights put into a dark Lanthorne, or Seraphicall Notions, high and ſublimate, but preſent you with a plain and practical Diſcourſs, deſiring to ſpeak from the heart to the heart.
<pb facs="tcp:151446:13"/>The Treatiſe is Tripartite, thereby reſembling the heart, which is Triangular; and 'tis my ſingle deſigne, to endeavour, that upon the points or corners of your hearts may be engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven your Dangers, Deliverances, and Duties; that ſo the mercies of God, which are Records of greateſt Import, may be preſerved with greateſt care, and you may be provoked to act with greateſt Conſcience for God.</p>
            <p>We cannot look back upon <hi>Adam</hi> in his lapſed Eſtate, but we may ſee a deluge of wrath breaking in upon whole mankinde, at the breach of the firſt Covenant; we cannot read over our own Diaries, but we may read our own Dangers, drawn up in black Characters of our ſins, as provoking God unto diſpleaſure againſt us, nay, the times that lately paſſed over us, preſented us with danger, from the ſword of men in the heat of warr; and now are we in dayly hazards from the arrows of the Almighty, in various and violent diſtempers.</p>
            <p>Again, we cannot ſeriouſly ſtudy the Goſpel, but our great Deliverance from wrath to come, by the precious bloud of our Crucified Jeſus, preſents it ſelf unto our view, nor can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately ſurvey our own Soules, but we may read the counterpane thereof, tranſcribed by the Eternal Spirit; nor own Experiences, but we may meet with large Volumes of eminent Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, perſonall and Nationall, wrought for us by the outſtretched arme of an Almighty God: Again, if we turn over thoſe holy leaves
<pb facs="tcp:151446:13"/>of the Scriptures of Truth, if we conſult the Experiences of Gods people in the Ages that are paſt, or ſeriouſly adviſe with our own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, when, in a right frame, we ſhall finde many Duties charged upon us, as our returnes to God, for our great Deliverances: The great God will not be a loſer by his mercies, he exſpecteth ſome incomes into the bank of his glory; if he have it not from us, he will have it out upon us; If we do not give it, he will take it. Deliverances are a great Talent put into the hands of men to trade withal for God; They that lap up this Talent in a napkin by forgetfulneſs, or ſquander it away by unſuitable actings, heap guilt upon their own ſoules, and ſhall be ſure, at the reckoning day, to finde this ſin, <hi>as the Iſraelites did an ounce of their golden calf,</hi> in all the rebukes of God upon them: The ſad Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof, hath been, and is much upon my heart, and hath been a principall induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to thruſt this Treatiſe into the world, which is not Polemical in the main intention of it, <hi>my Standard bearing this Motto,
<note place="margin">Zech. 8.19.</note> LO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E THE TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TH AND PEACE;</hi> nor is it provoking, I hope, to any,
<note place="margin">Iames 3.17.</note> being the product of that <hi>wiſdome, which is first pure, then peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> &amp;c. — I have avoided all bitterneſs, that I might not ſtirr up any prejudice: my buſineſs is to be a Remembrancer from the Lord, unto you, and to provoke unto love and good works, as the genuine improvement of grace and mercy received.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:151446:14"/>
            <p>I have not exactly methodiſed this Treatiſe, nor caſt it into the mould of the Title Page, but laid down all Sermon-wiſe, handling the Saints Dangers and Deliverances in the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and their Duties in the Applicatory part of it; in which, I have reſpect, as well to Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, as to Temporal Dangers and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, and with reſpect to all, as they ſtand in a perſonall or Relative capacity.</p>
            <p>I will not <hi>Cramben bis coctam dare,</hi> by Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomizing in the Epiſtle, what is largely preſſed in the body of the Diſcourſe: I ſhall therefore onely entreat you, to bewail before the Lord, that root which bringeth forth wormwood and gall amongſt us, that diſcontent and ſullenneſs of ſpirit, by means whereof God is not owned in, nor honoured for thoſe glorious vouchſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mercy, which have been matter of envie and aſtoniſhment in all the Nations about us; that land-flood of corrupt Principles and practiſes, which, like a ſwift and ſpreading Torrent hath laid a great part of the Nation under water; that ſpirit of bitterneſs and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt Godlineſs in the power, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the purity of it; and thoſe ſad diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about, which ſadly hinder the work of a thorough Goſpel-Reformation, &amp;c. all which are <hi>ſowre grapes,</hi> yea <hi>clusters of Gomorrah,</hi> and not ſuch a Vintage, which the Lord might reaſonably exſpect from a people of ſuch rich mercies, ſuch ſignal preſervations, and under the enjoyment of ſuch encouraging advantages as ours have been:
<pb facs="tcp:151446:14"/>O that your <hi>ſouls would mourn in ſecret places for theſe things!</hi> O that you were ſo affected with them, <hi>that you would refuſe your pleaſant bread!</hi> O that you would ſo reprove a carnal and careleſs Generation of men, by your lively act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings for God, that many, yea all, who have experienced the goodneſs of the Lord in emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent preſervations, may glorifie the name of the Lord by an Evangelical converſation, that ſo the preſence of <hi>God may ſtill give us rest, that our Engliſh Zion may be made an Eternal Excellency, a joy of many generations,
<note place="margin">Iſay 60.15, 18.</note> that our walls</hi> (through the divine Cuſtodiency) <hi>may ſtill be called Salvation and our gates praiſe.</hi> But though this ſpiritual Lethargy be incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in many, yet be ye, (O ye Ranſomed ones of the Lord) awakened unto duty, and let the ſenſe of mercy, in the eminent appearances of God to your help, in the daies of your diſtreſs, carry you like wind and tide, full ſail in your zeal for his Glory; in order to which, I ſhall humbly offer theſe hints unto you, and I entreat the people of my own charge to take ſpecial notice of them, as being mainly intended for them.</p>

            <p>You know and lament the negligence of ſome; and the wantonneſs of others: thin Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and empty ſeats, is not the complaint of a ſimple Miniſter,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.2.</note> Still <hi>deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby.</hi> Do not wean your ſelves from the breaſt, whilſt you are in a growing eſtate, and never think you are paſt growth,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4 13.</note> until you be come to <hi>a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> which ſtate of perfection, Scripture and your own experience, duly conſulted with, will tell you, is not attainable on this ſide Heaven.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Maintain an evangelical brotherly love
<pb facs="tcp:151446:17"/>amongſt your ſelves; Love is the greate Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Soder and Cement, a characteriſtical note of Chriſt's Diſciples, without which, the higheſt pretence to piety and profeſſion is under cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by the Holy Ghoſt;
<note place="margin">Iac. 3.14, 15, 16.</note> O how did Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans cling together in times of trouble! What friendly entertainment did Saints find in the hearts and houſes each of other, when they were forced from their dwellings by an enraged ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? how did the old Primitive and puritane love begin to ſpring up and flouriſh in <hi>England?</hi> And now, that we have no enemy to quarrel with, will you needs quarrel one with another? What an unſuitable return is this unto the God of Peace, for his aſtoniſhing mercies and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations? Ah friends, well may the Lord take this ill from his people, after ſuch notable deliverances as ours have been; it was a good wiſh of an Heathen <hi>

               <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.14. verſ. 18.</note> O then, preſerve this evidence for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven un-blurred in your ſouls, <hi>that you may know, you are paſſed from death unto life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you love the Brethren: let love be without diſſimulation; love not in word and in tongue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in deed and in truth:</hi> it is eaſy to make them two, who were never truly one, to make
<pb facs="tcp:151446:17"/>them foes who were never truly friends, to keep them oft from <hi>being one</hi> bread, who <hi>were never</hi> one body. And in caſe of difference, <hi>leave your gift at the Altar,</hi> not leave the Altar, that's not the mind of Chriſt, <hi>and goe and reconcile your ſelves: There is a memorable ſtory of Ariſtippus an Heathen, who went of his own accord to Aeſchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes his enemy, ſaying, ſhall we not be reconciled, until we become a Table-talk to all the Country? To whom Aeſchines replied, that he would gladly be at peace with him; remember therefore ſaid Ariſtippus, that although I am the elder, and the better man, yet I ſought firſt unto thee, thou art indeed ſaid Aeſchines a far better man than I, for I began the quarrel, and thou the reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> O ſtand not upon punctilios, but goe thou and do likewiſe, you know the ſad fruits of contention, where <hi>a</hi> ſcar-fire is, the bels ring backward; So, where this fire breaks forth in fellowſhip and fraternity, Religion is Retrograde; all things go backward and run into diſorder; Communion is broken, Prayer is hindred, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual edification neglected, Brotherly admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will not be borne, the weak are offended, and the mouths of the wicked are opened wide in reproaches and calumnies.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Preſerve oneneſs in Judgment: beware of dividing opinions and dividing in opinion; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for ſtability in judgement, for rooting in the faith: It's a great honour to be ſtanding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in falling times: be much and ſerious in ſearching the Scriptures, much and ſerious in
<pb facs="tcp:151446:18"/>examining your grounds of profeſſion: Look often to your foundation; be true to your own experiences,
<note place="margin">Cant. 1.8.</note> and recede not from your appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved principles: <hi>follow the foot-ſteps of the flock, keep cloſe to the Sheapheard tents,</hi> conforme to the pureſt times, the moſt primitive and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical practiſes: do not haſtily leave the <hi>good old way:</hi> meddle not with thoſe that are given to changes in fundamentals, Doctrinal or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical: <hi>Errour, as one ſaies, is a whirl-pool, firſt turns men round, and then ſucks them in:</hi> He has no ſure ſtanding, who leaves the top of the hill. <hi>Iſlebius Agricola, the firſt Antinomian, at laſt turned Papiſt.</hi> How gradual has errour been amongſt us? unto what a monſtrous bulk is Hereſy now grown, both as to perſons and opinions, which but a few years ſince was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſible? now low did ſome begin, who now are mounted upon the higheſt Pinacles? O then, ſtop the firſt leak, leaſt the Ship be immerſed; quench the firſt ſparks, leaſt the maiſter-timber become a flame; not onely keep, <hi>but contend earneſtly for the faith,
<note place="margin">Iude 3.</note> which was once delivered unto the Saints;</hi> we are the truſtees of Jeſus Chriſt, the treaſure that is committed to our truſt is very pretious, above the vaule of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, in the account of the great Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and <hi>that's an obligation to faithfulneſs, we are not to look onely to our ſelves, but to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, to that Doctrine which is tranſmitted</hi> to them: one <hi>generation teacheth</hi> another; <hi>and as we leave them Laws and other National privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
<pb facs="tcp:151446:18"/>ſo it would be ſad, if we ſhould not be as carefull to leave them the Goſpel.</hi> O then, <hi>as the Church is terrible as an army with banners,</hi> ſo is ſhe beautifull, when ſhe marcheth orderly under the Standard-Royal of truth, and ſurely, if we remember, how we have <hi>rejoyced in the ſalvation of our God, and, in his name have ſet up our banners,</hi> when formidable Armies were drawn up in great fury againſt us, we cannot but charge blame upon our ſelves, if we ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his Colours, and fly to the painted Pageants of the Prince of darkneſs.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Let not evil root in your hearts by the love of money: <hi>Lay not up your treaſures upon earth,</hi> leſt they keep your hearts too much out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſeek not great things for your ſelves, with the neglect of greater; <hi>Let not friendſhip with the world, put you into a ſtate of enmity with God:</hi> Remember what a friend God was unto you in the midſt of your late ſtraits and dangers: How little a value you ſet upon your ſtocks and lands, your ſhops and trades, in the heat of the late dreadfull Warrs, how <hi>they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced were as though they rejoiced not, they that bought, as though they poſſeſſed not;</hi> and will you now doat upon the world, and <hi>put any truſt in deceitfull riches?</hi> What a ſad preſage is this of another War? what a blemiſh upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours? what a Reproach upon Religion? There is no ſin ſo contrary to a true Saint, as earthly-mindedneſs, whoſe Converſation ought to be in heaven, his inheritance lying there; O
<pb facs="tcp:151446:19"/>then, roul away this reproach from you; be content with food and raiment, though none of the fineſt; time was, when you would have valued peace, and the Goſpel, as choice mercies, though with courſe dreſs and Diet; make ſhift a while, ere long, you ſhall be <hi>cloathed with long white Robes, clean and fine, and ſhall drink of that wine, which ſhall be ever new in the kingdome of your Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Laſtly, Be moſt intent upon the <hi>quatuor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſima,</hi> the <hi>four last things;</hi> Let your thoughts be much ſpent upon death, theſe dying times, by way of preparation, that it may come without a ſting and terrour to you; of Judgment, by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupation, <hi>judging your ſelves here, that you may not be judged</hi> hereafter of Hell, by way of preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, waiting for, and making ſure your Intereſt in Jeſus, <hi>who will deliver you from wrath to come.</hi> And of heaven, by way of prelibation, taſting the peace, joy and comfort of that bleſſed Eſtate, living upon the foretaſtes of heaven; living up to the holineſs of it, <hi>and giving all diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure,</hi> that as the Lord hath given you an earneſt of his mercy, in temporal Preſervation, ſo the Lord may give you the full Treaſures of his grace in everlaſting Salvation.</p>
            <p>To ſhut up all, (And indeed 'tis time), for according to the Rules of Architecture, the two porches of it are much too big for the building;) my witneſs is in heaven, that I covet not the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of men, I am not carried on by a popular

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:151446:39"/>was the Lords care in <hi>Jonah</hi>'s preſervation? There is a ſtorm at Sea; <hi>Jonah</hi> is caſt over-board, but God prepareth a fiſh ready to receive him; but how ſhall he do for light in that dark priſon?

And who ſhall waft him to the ſhore when ſet at liberty? Why, God is not weary, he will carry him through all; what a bundle of miracles are wrapt up together in the preſervation of this one Saint? well might the Apoſtle perſwade the faithful <hi>to be careful for nothing,</hi> Phil. 4. verſ. 6. which (as the Seraphims in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.) is anſwered by Saint <hi>Peter</hi> 1 Epiſt. chap. 5 verſ. 9. Caſt all your care upon God, under this aſſurance, that God careth for you: were we not ignorant of Gods care over us; or low in faith, that we dare not believe his word of promiſe to us, we might free our ſelves from much vexing ſolicitude, and anxiety of minde where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we are tormented. It was a noble ſpeech of <hi>John Careleſs</hi> in a letter to Mr. <hi>Philpot, I will now ſing care away, for now my ſoul is turned to his old reſt again, and hath taken a ſweet nap in the lap of Chriſt, I have caſt my care upon the Lord who careth for me, and will be careleſs according to my name:</hi> It is our work to caſt care, it is Gods work to take care; let us not then by ſoul-dividing thoughts take the Lords work out of his hand; <hi>If the care of all the Churches came upon Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. verſ. 28. that it was his every days work with an holy ſolicitude, to care for them. Oh, much more may we affirm that the Lord careth for all his people, and ſuiteth his care to all their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to which his eminent appearances for them in a day of diſtreſs, give ſignal teſtimony.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond truth which this Doctrine commendeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, is this, <hi>That the Saints are a people of Gods ſpecial love, they lye in the very boſome of God, his Banner over them is love, and as holineſs to the Lord was engraven upon the bells
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:151446:40"/>of the horſes, and upon every pot in Jeruſalem,</hi> Zech. 14. verſ. 20. So <hi>love to the Saints,</hi> is engraven upon every-diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God to his people, even when he rebuketh them he loveth them, becauſe his affection is much toward them, therefore he afflicteth them; <hi>Hear ye the rod ſaith the Lord,</hi> Mich. 6. verſe 9. Oh, it ſpeaketh love, many of the Saints have read much of the Lords love, writ in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their own blood. How doth the love of God ſhine forth in its fulleſt luſtre, when he appeareth as an healing God in a bleeding hour? Who can expreſs the ſweetneſs of this ſpiced wine? What a reliſh of love do the Saints taſte in that comfort and hearts-eaſe, which the Lord gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them at the ſhutting up of a ſtorm? The outgoings of God were remarkable, even to aſtoniſhment in fetching Iſrael from the Iron Furnace; there were mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of mercy, heaps upon heaps, the wiſdom and power of God were writ in ſuch capital letters, that they that runned, might read not <hi>digitum</hi> onely, but <hi>dexteram Dei,</hi> not the finger but the right hand of God; and what were the motives to all theſe mercies? the Lord draweth up all theſe lines into the center of love, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord loved thy fathers, therefore he brought thee out in his ſight, with his mighty power out of Egypt.</hi> So chap. 7. verſ. 8. <hi>Becauſe the Lord loved you, hath he brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the houſe of bondmen, from the hand of Pharach King of Egypt;</hi> Love was the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome which bore all theſe great burthens; the ſpring which ſet all the wheels in going; <hi>becauſe the Lord loved you:</hi> indeed, ſometimes the dark ſide of the cloud is toward the Saints; his love is like the Sun muffled up in a thick miſt, or rather as a candle ſhut up in a dark Lanthorn; that they ſee no out-ſhining of Gods favour, as in caſes of deſertion or great affliction, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.17. ſometimes light and love break forth in ſome ſmall beams, through the thick cloud of apprehended diſpleaſure; that it is with the Saints, as with a traveller, in the duskiſh evening or ſtar-light night, when the moon ſitteth, <hi>That the light is neither clear nor dark,</hi> Zech. 14. verſ. 6. the ſhip neither
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:151446:40"/>rideth upon high waters, nor yet ſticketh upon the ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: they neither feed high at a feaſt of fat things full of marrow, nor yet are kept to the bread of mourners, nor wine of aſtoniſhment; their condition is a mixt and middle eſtate; hope and fear, ſorrow and ſolace are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven; <hi>as chaſtened, yet not killed; as ſorrowful, yet in ſome meaſure rejoycing, as dying, and yet alive;</hi> though the air be duskiſh, yet they can diſcover ſome lines of love drawn here and there, in ſuch a mercie, ſuch a favour, ſuch an act of goodneſs, ſuch a gracious providence: Oh! ſaith a ſervant of the Lord, if the Lord did not love me, he would not have called me off from ſuch vain and vicious courſes, he would not have made known the counſels of his grace by his ſpirit unto me, he would not have accepted my poor ſervices, nor given ſuch returns to my broken prayers, nor haſted relief unto me, in ſuch or ſuch an afflicted eſtate.</p>
            <p>Oh! this is much the caſe of weak believers, they are often at the turning of the ſcales; one while, hope up and fear down, another while fear up and hope down; and ſometime the ballance hangeth in an even poiſe: It is oftentimes thus in a ſpiritual ſence, and truly 'tis many times ſuch upon temporal accounts, they are much at a loſs in their own ſpirits: But now when the Lord turneth again the captivity of his people; when he cometh in ſignally, and ſeaſonably to their help, in the time of their greateſt ſtreights, when they could not tell what to do, and thought all loſt, Oh then the bright ſide of the cloud is toward them, <hi>the vail is taken away, and they behold with open face, the glorious love of God unto them:</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. verſ. 27. <hi>When Jacob ſaw the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons which Joſeph ſent to carry him into Egypt, his ſpirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived,</hi> it put a new life into his dead heart, and dead hopes; the old man gathered up his ſpirits, which were ſunk with grief for the death of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and fear of <hi>Benjamin</hi>'s miſcariage; Oh! ſaith he, <hi>Joſeph is yet alive:</hi> So when the ſaints of God ſee the hand of God viſibly appearing, yea mightily out-ſtretched, to fetch them off

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall receive the charge, and endeavour to ſecure the truth within ſome ſconces, and therefore do anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is confeſſed, that the onely wiſe God doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence outward mercies with an equal hand to the good and to the bad, to him that ſweareth, and to him that feareth an oath, and this according to the ordinary courſe of providence: proſperity doth not alwayes ſpring up upon the root of piety; God doth not diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the precious and the vile by ſun and rain; yea, many times the worſt men live under the warmeſt Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine; <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. verſ. 14. <hi>God filleth their bellies with hid treaſures;</hi> they have full meals of the worlds delicates; riches and honour by the belly, (as our phraſe is); and who are theſe, who like <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s kine are ſo fat and well-favoured? why? they are the wicked, who like dogs, when their bellies are full, are turned out of doors, <hi>they have their portion in this life,</hi> their <hi>Chelech,</hi> their part and ſhare; the word is uſed 1. in a military ſenſe for the ſouldiers pay, or his part in the ſpoyles of a conquered enemy, thus <hi>Abraham</hi> calleth it, <hi>the portion of the men that went with him, Gen.</hi> 14. verſ. 24.2. 'Tis uſed in a civil ſenſe, for the ſhare or portion which children

So that, the wiſe man in this Verſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth the vain, yet general opinion of worldlings, who fondly, and as falſly, meaſure Gods love and their lot in the ſame Omer; And in this he ballaſteth the Saints, who are apt to topple over, in their own ſtormes and the wicked's calmes, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The diſpenſations of God, according to his ordinary rate of providence, do not deciſively conclude love or hatred, a juſt man may have all his moiſture drunk up, with the arrows of the Almighty, when the unjuſt may have his bones full of marrow: the Saint may be poor with <hi>Job,</hi> even to a Proverb, and the ſinner may abound with wealth even to the parable: Good <hi>Joſiah</hi> may dy the ſame death, with wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> both ſlain by the hands of their enemies: God will not write his love in ſuch legible characters that every pur-blind worldling may read this ſecret, indeed <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had the honour to be baptiſed <hi>Jehovah-ſhammah, the Lord is there, Ezek.</hi> 48.35. but this engraving was not found upon <hi>Dives</hi> his palace; <hi>It is the heart not the houſe which beareth this Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and that not in letters of Gold, but of grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. No man can give a certain and infallible judgement of love or hatred towards another perſon, by all that is before him; indeed men may ſpeak hopefully, in the judgment of charity, and draw up a hopeful concluſion of another man's ſtanding in grace, from what is viſibly good; when the exerciſe of faith is vigorous and the actings of the ſpirit of holineſs are viſible and uniform, as, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. verſ. 3, 4. The Apoſtle mentioneth <hi>their labour of love, their work of faith, and patience of hope in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, from which he deduceth this concluſion, knowing Brethren, beloved of God your election; though the white ſtone, with the new name written in it, is known to no man certainly, but to him that hath received it, yet holy men,
<note place="margin">D. <hi>Preſton.</hi>
                  </note> in ſome degree, are known one to another, to make the communion of ſaints the ſweeter;</hi> yet cannot ſuch a concluſion be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:151446:42"/>drawn from external acts of providence, infallibly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine love or hatred by his outward adminiſtrations; how ſadly would the men of that generation have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caried, if they had aſſerted <hi>Eſau</hi> to have been a perſon dear to God, and peculiarly in his favour; becauſe he proſpered ſo farre, and faſt in worldly greatneſs and glory, who had four hundred men at his heels, and the father of ſo many Dukes: and if they had concluded <hi>Jacob</hi> to have been a perſon of Gods hatred, becauſe he was a poor ſhepherd, and met with ſuch hard meaſure, from his uncle <hi>Laban,</hi> ſeing the Lord determined other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. verſ. 13. <hi>Jacob have I loved, and Eſau have I hated:</hi> It was much the ſinne of <hi>Job</hi>'s three friends in aſſerting <hi>Job</hi>'s afflictions to be the fruits and evidences of Gods diſpleaſure, againſt a perſon hated by him, when God himſelf giveth teſtimony to <hi>Job</hi> ſo fully at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and end of this book.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I do not aſſert, that God's outward diſpenſations although in an extraordinary manifeſtation of his power and goodneſs, do fully and alwayes ſpeak forth his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar love to a perſon or people, when their teſtimony is ſingle, and ſomething elſe be not ſuperadded to render it more authentick: for wicked <hi>Cham</hi> had the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in the ark, from the deluge of waters, as godly <hi>Sem</hi> had; and <hi>Samariah</hi>'s ſiege was raiſed in a way of miracle under wicked <hi>Jehoram,</hi> as well as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s was under good <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> Compare 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. verſe 6. with Chap. 19. verſ. 35. It was falſe Divinity that thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> preached, when the Viper faſtened on <hi>Paul</hi>'s hand, <hi>No doubt this man is a murtherer, whom, though he hath eſcaped the Sea, yet vengeance ſuffereth not to live,</hi> Acts 28. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. which our Saviour fully conſulteth in the caſe of the <hi>Galileans,</hi> and the eighteen perſons on whom the tower fell in <hi>Siloe, Luke</hi> 13. verſ. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But the glorious and remarkable outgoings of God when falling in with the witneſs of grace, and the ſpirit; when they are the returns of the Saints prayers, the fruits of their holy wraſtlings, and the iſſue of their hope, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:151446:42"/>in the womb of Gods gracious promiſes, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable concluſions of divine favour, and do very much ſeal to the peculiarity of God's love; thus the Saints in their own caſes, can diſtinguiſh love from hatred by the things which are before them: they know the voice of Chriſt, and read the love of their father in the ſtreight lines of his providencial favours toward them, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 87. verſ. 2. <hi>God loveth the gates of Zion,</hi> how doth this appear?
<note place="margin">Trap. <hi>in loc.</hi> All my thoughts are upon thee with greateſt delight: All my bowels are in thee. making them to be the words of God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing plenty of grace and comfort to them as from overflowing overſlowing fountain though other expoſitours think them to be the Pſalmiſts word, ſee Mr. <hi>Jackson,</hi> in loc.</note> why, verſ. 7. God ſaith, <hi>All my ſprings are in thee:</hi> his wiſdome, goodneſs, mercy, power, &amp;c. are not in <hi>Zion,</hi> as water in the ciſterne, pump'd in and ſoon run out, but like water in the fountain; ſtreams of mercy, flouds of favour, and flowings forth of loving kindneſs; Oh! it is clear, God loveth Zion, if all his ſprings be in her; eſpecially when drought is upon the earth, and other parts of <hi>Judah</hi> are like <hi>Gideon</hi>'s fleece: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Thou haſt in love to my ſoul delivered it from the pit of corruption:</hi> good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> read love in the diſpenſations of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, and putteth that Interpretation upon his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous reſtitution to health: Surely he doth much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt the generation of God's people, and wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the mercies of God alſo, who concludeth, that God loveth us not, becauſe he hath proſpered our warfare, and underwriteth hatred to all thoſe glorious victories, which the Lord of hoſts hath given to his people in theſe Nations, and then, when a day of diſtreſs was ſadly upon the godly, and the conteſt was very much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſeed of the woman, and the ſeed of the ſerpent; Yet I deſire, we may all look after other evidences of divine love amongſt us; theſe are good ſuperſtructures where the foundation is well laid, and are Zion's ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt <hi>the gates of hell,</hi> provided, <hi>everlaſting doors be ſet open, that the King of glory may come in, and keep court amongſt us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This Inference may be drawn from the point, <hi>That the ſiunes of ſaints are circumſtanciated</hi> with higheſt aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations: the care of God over them, and his love unto them in their diſtreſſed eſtate, againſt both which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:151446:43"/>they offend in ſinning, do give a ſad tincture to their ſinnes: Sin is ſin in any perſon, but circumſtances do render it much more ſinfull: It was high water as to the guilt of ſinne, for <hi>Zimri</hi> a Prince of a chief houſe of the <hi>Simeonites,</hi> to bring a <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> woman into his tent, and commit whoredome with her, when the Lord had ſo eminently appeared for Iſrael in turning <hi>Balaam</hi>'s curſes into bleſſings and ſaving them from the ſword of <hi>Midian, Numb.</hi> 25. verſ. 6.

Ah brethren! hath a day of diſtreſs been upon us? and hath the Lord ſtood by and ſtrengthened us in all attempts which have been made againſt us? Have we been ſtars and ſtill are we, in the hands Jeſus Chriſt? hath the Lord made us a fenced brazen wall unto the people of this nation, when we have taken forth the precious from the vile, in obedience to Gods command and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Order? have they fought againſt us and not prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? and whence was it that attempts againſt us ſucceeded not? Why? Becauſe the Lord hath been with us to ſave us and deliver us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.19, 20. Oh brethren! what have our returns been? what ſence have we of theſe mercies
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:151446:56"/>upon our ſpirits? what apprehenſions of our preſent ſtanding?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Oh, <hi>Let us conſider, How deep a ſhare we have had in all the National mercies and preſervations,</hi> if the ſhip had been wrackt we ſhould hardly have eſcaped to land on broken boards; if the enemy had prevailed; that party had been conquered, that intereſt daſht in pieces which we owned and adhered unto, what quarter, think ye, ſhould we have had? however men of other capacities might have ſped, it would have been ill enough with us, we ſhould not onely have ſuffered in a common capacity, as thoſe who abetted the Parliamentary intereſt againſt the Royal Cauſe and Party, but as Incendiaries, as men (in the ſence of our adverſaries) who had blown the trumpet of rebellion, and preach't up a ſpirit of Sedition amongſt our people; nay, men of our own coat, and many of our own charge, would have helped forward our calamity: But now through the appearances of a good God, thoſe ſtorms of blood and war are ſcattered; peace is reſtored, and we enjoy as large a ſhare as any, in the ſafety and tranquility of the Nation.</p>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Conſider, what yoaks have been put upon our necks, what impoſitions upon our conſciences, what innovations and offenſive ceremonies have been obtruded upon us:</hi> How many godly Miniſters have been courted, ſilenced, ſuſpended, ejected, exiled? not becauſe their principles were vitious, their lives ſcandalous or their doctrines erroneous: not becauſe they could not preach, as being ignorant, or becauſe they would not preach, as being negligent; but becauſe they would not kiſs the Calves, and ſubmit to that which was then called Uniformity, and that in every punctilio and ceremony: How many choice Divines have had great reaſonings within their own ſpirits, and much arguing one with another, whether they ſhould yield to all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ceremonies, to gain an opportunity to honour God in the courſe of their Miniſtery, or elſe quit their places and people, yea the nation alſo rather then diſhonour God,

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Conſider, what oppoſition we met withal, in the years that are paſt, by men of carnal ſpirits and principles, even in our own places, when we have reproved their wickedneſs and conteſted againſt their adored vanities:</hi> How have many godly Miniſters been ſlighted by the prophane Rabble, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking their Sabbath-breaking, when they could plead <hi>the book of liberty and the Royal Sanction?</hi> Nay, how many
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:151446:57"/>have been ſecretly traduced and openly reproached by men of our own profeſſion? how have they poiſoned the mindes of our hearers, and have laboured to pull down what we have built up, or build their own hay and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as ſuperſtructures, on that foundation which we have laid? How have they branded us with names of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, that ſo they might loſen the affections of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from our perſons, and their regards from our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry? How ſad have the complaints of ſome been for want of a good neighbor-hood? Good Miniſters were thin in moſt places, for one faithful, honeſt, painful, and conſcientions Miniſter; ten yea twenty bad enough might be found in every County: But now, though ſome of our people are the ſame in ſpirits and principles, yet are they far more tame and quiet under reproof; though they run away, like wild horſes with the Bit in their mouthes, yet they do not caſt their Riders; and where the ſtream is ſtopt in its wonted courſe; yet it ſilently recurs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſwelling over or breaking down the banks; <hi>Bryars and thorns may now be touched without an iron Gauntlet, and we dwell ſafely, though among Scorpions,</hi> Ezek. 2.6. Wickedneſs hath no eſtabliſhment now by a law, but meets with the check and frowns of Authority in all the kinds of it; And now for one bad one, we have five, yea ten good neighbors; yea many Counties being now planted, yea filled with godly Miniſters; ſo that was it not for our private diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and thoſe unhappy Animoſities which they kindle amongſt us, what ſweet communion might we maintain?

<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> Con. in Pſal. 119.92.

            <p n="1">1. The ſentence of death was reverſed, which was paſſed in <hi>foro externo,</hi> for God had ſent him a ſpeciall meſſage by the hand of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to ſet his houſe in order, for ſaith he, <hi>thou ſhalt die and not live,</hi> chap. 38.</p>

            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:151446:73"/>
            <p n="2">2. The reverſall of the ſentence of death, was the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle return and procurement of his own prayers and tears. for ver. 5. The Lord gives a ſecond command to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, to go to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and deliver this meſſage from him: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the God of David thy father; I have heard thy prayers, I have ſeen thy tears,</hi> ſo that as <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> ſaid of <hi>Samuel</hi> her ſon, 1 Sam. 1. ver. 27. <hi>For this child I prayed, and the Lord hath given me my petition which I ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him:</hi> The ſame might <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> for my life I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wept, and the Lord hath given me my peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Nay the Lord makes a large addition to his life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.4. he asked life and the Lord gave him length of days, the life of man twice told, in our ordinary law compute, even fifteen years, which did very much accent the Lords mercy, ſeeing <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was ſo exceeding earneſt for life, having then no Son to ſucced in the throne and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Church and ſtate being very unſetled.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This alſo gave a great <hi>Emphaſis</hi> to the mercy, in that he had ſuch a ſuddain return to his prayer; The Lord did not make him wait long for anſwer, thereby tormenting his ſpirit with perplexing fears, but before the Prophet was gone out into the middle Court, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 20.4. the word of the Lord came unto him, the Lord met him and ſent him back with a meſſage of life to <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> Oh tis matter of great comfort to have a quick diſpatch of buſineſs, eſpecially in things relating to life and death.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Yet further, the immediate appearance of power from the Lord, in effecting the cure, doth marvailouſly greaten the mercy; that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſhould be viſited with ſo ſharpe a diſtemper,

            <p n="6">6. And then, that the great God ſhould work a miracle in heaven, to confirm his faith in the certainty of the cure, that he ſhould command the Sun to a retrograde motion, to go back ten degrees, not onely the ſhadow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the dyal of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> for that had not been ſo viſible and univerſal, but the body of the Sun in the heaven, for ſo tis, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.8. <hi>So the Sun turned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down;</hi>

               </note> whereby that day became ten hours longer, then otherwiſe it ſhould have been, allowing half an hour for a degree, and the motion of the Sun regular in its going backward and coming forward: which things with ſafety may be ſuppoſed, ſeeing the miracle was ſo notable and amazing, that the King of <hi>Babilon</hi> (put on 'tis likely by his Aſtrologers) ſent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors on purpoſe, as to congratulate <hi>Hezakiahs</hi> reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, ſo to know the certainty and manner of that great wonder (a brute or flying report whereof he had heard) 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.31.</p>
            <p>Now though <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was a good man (few better) and had obtained of the Lord ſuch a notable cure, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiated with ſo many miracles, yet he was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er come into the world again, but the Pompe, and <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieur</hi> of it waſh't away the ſenſe of this great mercy; for being taken with the King of <hi>Babylons</hi> complement,

And therefore friends, watch narrowly over your own hearts, and be earneſt in prayer, that the Lord would keep them in an humble and holy frame, or elſe, you'l ſoon finde that as health comes on, holineſs and humility will go off, and your old companions and corruptions will complement your ſpirits into their former frame.</p>

            <p>I ſhall lend you ſome help in your ſerious enquiry, by ſhewing you what ſins are mentioned in Scripture, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducent of ſickneſs, and which God either threatneth or puniſheth with diſeaſes: As,</p>

But now when the ſpeakings of God in his works, run in a paralell line with the ſpeakings of God in his word, when they fall in with his revealed will, they do then ſafely interpret the mind of God, and are a good gloſſe upon the text, both as to the <hi>quod</hi> and <hi>quando</hi> of a duty, ſhewing that it ought to be done, and that then is the time for the doing of it: thus <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> when he had received a prohibition from heaven, not to ſacrifice <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and beheld a ramme caught in a thicket by the horns, interprets the mind of God by that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and offers up the ramme in the ſtead of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 22. ver. 12, 13. by a divine Prolepſis, anticipating that law of redemption, which afterwards was enacted and publiſhed by God himſelf, Exod. 13. ver. 13. <hi>all the firſt

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:151446:79"/>ſhould walk in the fellowſhip of the Goſpel, and advance Religion, and the power of Godlineſs, the Scriptures plainly declare to be the will of God: that ſuch things are ſeizable, that there is hope of a good iſſue in ſuch undertakings we have the word of Gods faithfulneſs for, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. ver. 25: 26, 27. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. ver. 11.19, 20, 21, 22.

If theſe and other Scriptures be conſulted with, they will afford matter of great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the Saints of God, which breathe after Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's beauty and glory.</p>
            <p>And that it is a duty incumbent upon the Lords people to endeavour theſe things, beſides the inward witneſs of the Spirit in their own hearts, we have the teſtimony of the Spirit in the Scripture of truth. And that this is the period of time, in the ſecret appointments of the onely wiſe God, and the Saints of this generation, the people aſſigned by him for the carrying on of theſe works, may be read in the diſpenſations of God amongſt and toward us; what have the people of God had more in former Ages, by way of call from God, or encouragement from men, then we have? Did God give them reſt and peace from their enemies, forraign and domeſtick? So hath he given us in ſome meaſure: Did the Lord pull down thoſe perſons and powers amongſt them, who authoriſed or abetted Idolatry and profaneneſs? hath he not done the ſame amongſt us? Did the Lord give them the protection, and encouragement of prudent and pious governours? is it not ſo with us? had they the Prophets of the Lord to quicken them up, and ſtrengthen their hands? have not we alſo faithful and learned Miniſters, who from preſs and pulpit call upon us, and excite us to do great things for the Lord? <hi>Oh what glorious work, would thoſe bleſſed Spirits, who are now at reſt, have made in</hi> England, <hi>if they had enjoyed our opportunities!</hi> Let me commend the practiſe of the Saints unto you, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. v. 31. <hi>Then had the Churches reſt throughout all Judea and Galilee, and Samariah;</hi> And how did they improve their Halcyon

Oh ye ſervants of the Lord, whom he hath ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed from the grave, and from the ſword. Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and Chriſtians, lay aſide your private inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, and animoſities, and fall upon theſe great works, as your reſpective ſtations give you advantage, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, that ye may have this Motto engraven on your tombes, <hi>Here lie ſuch and ſuch, who David-like, ſerved their own generations by the will of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let me adde theſe two Corrolaries,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God hath aſſigned you your particular times for working, <hi>Stat ſua cuique dies.</hi>

How eaſily can the great God diſperſe that vapour, and melt that cloud into dew? there is a great Arbitrer of all things, that can thunder the proud Emperour under his bed, and write the great King in three or four words into trembling; that can ſend a fly to fetch the triple crown before his Tribunal, make an hair, or the kernil of a raiſon, as mortal as <hi>Goliah</hi>'s ſpear, that can unſpeak the world into nothing, and blow down a great bubble with an eaſie breath: that by drawing one nail, can throw down the ſtatelieſt building, and undreſs your

<note place="margin">Second part of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this Doctrine of Gods appearances in mercy, and the Saints deliverances from danger, to the generality of men and women, who fear and know the Lord, and to believers, as they meet in Chriſt the common-head, and in the Church the common body, and I ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the truth propoſed,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In a mixt ſence, referring both to temporall and ſpirituall preſervations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In a pure ſpirituall ſence, referring to recovering and Redeeming grace.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt ſence, I ſhall interweave ſomething of a ſpiritual nature, it being uſual with the Holy Ghoſt, to mingle Goſpel treaſures with the lading of the world in the ſame bottome, and this I ſhall do in two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I do humbly entreat the ſervants of the Lord, <hi>to keep up the memorial of the Lords mercies, to keep Diaries of their great deliverances,</hi> to preſerve Records of their ſignall preſervations, And ſecondly, as occaſion ſerves, <hi>to communicate and impart them to others,</hi> for I ſhall twiſt theſe two together: Oh let not God loſe the glory of any mercy, let not time wear off the remembrance of eminent preſervations: God expects that his works ſhould be regiſtred by us, as well as our words are regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by him, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. verſ. 16. This was commanded by the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. verſ. 18, 19. <hi>David</hi> was much in the practice of this duty, read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. ver. 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He gives a royal ſummons, as by the ſound of a trumpet, to all the Lords people to give their attendance, whileſt he diſcovereth over, the gracious Adminiſtrations of the Lord; he is no niggard, no cloſe-fifted Miſer, that hoards up all, and keeps all cloſe to himſelf, but keeps open houſe, and invites all the Lords people to his banquet of wine: He
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:151446:82"/>would fain lift up the great name of God in the world, and diſplay his bounty, that they which have hard thoughts of God, may be convinced of their errour, and make a recantation; and that all dejected Saints may by his example and experience, be encouraged to roul them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, upon God, under aſſurance of comfort and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in an evil day; which will appear to be his deſigne, for, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. he gives a generall invitation to all people, <hi>to ſee, and admire the wonders which were wrought by God</hi> (tis like) in <hi>Egypt, he is terrible in his doings towards the children of men;</hi> implying probably the dreadfull exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his vengeance upon the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in thoſe ten Plagues he ſent amongſt them, and in bringing in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the red Sea upon their whole Hoſt, as appears Verſ. 6. <hi>He turned the ſea into dry land, they went through the flood on foot,</hi> to wit the children of Iſrael; <hi>there did we rejoice,</hi> as <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. doth fully ſhew, when <hi>Moſes</hi> and the people celebrated the praiſes of God, and by that ſong not onely kept up a lively ſence of that glorious preſervation in their own hearts, but tranſmitted the memorial of it unto poſteritie, that the <hi>children then unborn,</hi> might read in that, the glorious appearances of God for his people: Oh how few ſuch ſongs are penned in our dayes? what little care is taken to commemorate deliverances? though they have been ſo great and many: Is it not the ſhame of this Nation, that the next age ſhall finde no Records (and if any ſuch Compendiums) of thoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful deliverances, which we have had, that ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of mercy and mirrours of loving-kindeneſs ſhould be lap'd up in the duſt, and printed onely on the ſand? Oh that ſome faithfull and able perſon might be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to this work, to write a Chronicle of late tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that poſterity may ſee, what a God their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours have had! and through how many ſtraights of warre, and ſeas of blouds peace and the Goſpel, light and liberty, have travailed down unto them! This was done by King <hi>Ahaſuerus;</hi> his perſonal preſervation from the Treaſon of his two Chamberlains, was recorded in
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:151446:83"/>the book of the Chronicles, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 6.2. What proviſion did <hi>Mordecai</hi> and the Jews make, to keep up the memorial of that great mercy, in their deliverance from <hi>Hamans</hi> wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bloody conſpiracy, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 9.27, 28. <hi>The inhabitants of Geneva, ſtamped new mony with this inſcription,</hi> poſt tenebras lux, <hi>after darkneſs light, in memory of the reformation begun among them. The Helvetians cauſed the day and year (when the Goſpel begun to take place amongſt them) to be engraven in a pillar, in letters of Gold, for a perpetual memory to all poſterity.</hi> Have not our Anceſtors taken care to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the memorial of eighty eight, and the fifth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber?</hi> and ſhall we raiſe no monument, neither commit any thing to the preſs which may preſerve the memory of our late mercies? will it not be <hi>Englands</hi> ſin before God, and <hi>Englands</hi> ſhame before men?</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the eighth verſe, he gives a general exhortation to the Redeemed of the Lord, to mention with thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, the great things wrought by a great God for them: Oh! bleſs our God, ye people (concerned in theſe mercies) let your hearts ſilently breath forth his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; let your meditations be much, and often taken up with thoughts of Gods goodneſs (which is more I fear then moſt of us do) but ſtay not here, do not make this as the land-mark, and boundary of your duty, but make the voyce of his praiſe to be heard, let it have an Eccho in the world, by communicating, and ſpeaking over, what, and how deliverance came from the Lord unto you.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He layes down the reaſon of this call to praiſe, verſ. 9. becauſe he holdeth our ſoul in life, or puts our ſouls into life, alas! when a day of diſtreſs was upon us, our hearts did even ſinke within us, life was gone, joy was gone, hope was gone, and heart was gone too in ſome perſons. There is a ſtrange receſs and retirement of the ſoul, under great and ſudden calamities, it lyes cloſe, like a poor debtor within doors, the blood and ſpirits retire; little of activity appears: nay, ſome in ſudden ſurprizals, have even dyed away into ſwooning, through fear: It was thus with <hi>Saul,</hi> though a valiant
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:151446:83"/>Prince, when he heard what evill was coming upon him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. verſ. 20. <hi>He fell ſtreightway all along upon the earth, and there was no ſtrength in him:</hi> And whence was this ſwouning fit? why, from fear, he was fore afraid; and why was he afraid? becauſe of the words of the Witches, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.20. This was old <hi>Elies</hi> caſe, when tidings were brought unto him, that the Army of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was routed, <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas</hi> ſlain, and the Ark of God taken, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. verſ. 17, 18. <hi>He fell from off the ſeat backward by the ſide of the gate; and his neck brake and he dyed;</hi> I, but here the Prophet ſaith, God holdeth our ſouls in life, or lives <hi>Be-chaiim,</hi> and ſuffereth not our feet to be moved, gives us a ſure foot-hold and ſafe ſtanding in our preſent peace and well-fare.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He mentions the diſtreſs that were upon them, in the nature and in the kind of them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Thou, O God haſt tryed us as ſilver is tryed:</hi> How is that? why, in the fornace of affliction; thou broughteſt us into the net, <hi>Thou layedſt affliction upon our loins, thou haſt cauſed men to ride over our heads—we went through fire and through water;</hi> How fully doth the carriages of former times paraphraſe upon theſe verſes? How have the ſufferings of many Saints ran parallel with theſe expreſſions? <hi>but thou broughteſt us out into a wealthy place</hi>—well-watered, as the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, a place of ſprings and rivers; by which he means a proſperous eſtate, in that full plenty and ſecurity, which he, with the Church then enjoyed: And therefore, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13, 14. He ſpeaks his ſence of theſe mercies, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvedneſs of his ſpirit, to act in thankfulneſs ſuitable to theſe engagements.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>I will go into thy houſe with burnt-offerings, and will pay thee my vows, which I promiſed with my lips, and ſpake with my mouth, when I was in trouble:</hi> A good reſolution of a gallant man? Oh! that ſuch a ſpirit in the power of it, was upon us. Did not I? Did not others? Did not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates? Did not Miniſters? protect, promiſe, covenant, in the day of our diſtreſs? Have we paid our vows? Have we performed our promiſes? The Lord help us to ſee,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:151446:84"/>and to humble our ſelves much before the Lord, for our violations of promiſes, and proteſtations, both to God and man.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He ſtands upon the mount of God, and by way of proclamation calls in all the people of God, that they may hear the ſtories of Gods mercies unto himſelf; when he had mentioned the great things God had done for his Church, he comes down to a particular narrative of what God had done for himſelf, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>Come and hear all ye that fear God, and I will tell you what God hath done for my ſoul—Le-myrheſhi,</hi> which word being of a doubtful ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and uſed for both ſoul and life, in reference to things of a temporal and ſpiritual concernment, we need not confine it to either.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Ye have the holy ſummons, <hi>Come,</hi> a word of much uſe both in a good and in a bad ſence, there is in Scripture mentioned a religious <hi>come,</hi> and a rebellious <hi>come:</hi> the Saints have their <hi>come,</hi> and the wicked have their <hi>come</hi> there's too much of the laſt come in our days, and too little of the firſt, if there was more communion, this come would be more uſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The perſons to whom the ſummon is directed, expreſt.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. By a particular Character, they are ſuch as fear God.</item>
               <item>2. By a note of univerſality, they are all that fear God; onely they that fear God, and all they that fear God are ſummoned.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="3">3. Ye have the matter of the ſummons; or the end wherefore the ſummons is ſent forth, and that is that he might in the audience of them all, make a full and true report of what the great God hath done for his ſoul.</p>
            <p>So that the words hold forth a double duty.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To conſider the mercies of God.</item>
               <item>2. To communicate the mercies of God.</item>
            </list>
            <p>You may ſee from hence, <hi>That it is a duty by way of ſpecial incumbency upon the Lords people, to commemmorate themſelves and to communicate to others, the vouchſafements of grace and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:151446:84"/>mercy, which they have had from the Lord;</hi> as to fix the ſenſe and remembrance of mercies received upon their own hearts, ſo to give their hearts vent, like full veſſels, in frequent mentioning their preſervations unto others; it is a commendable practice, there is much of God in it; It hath the ſeal of the beſt men; it hath much in it, that ſpeaks men to be good, and that makes good men much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: See the practice of the Lords people, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 78.3, 4. <hi>Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us, we will not hide them from their children, ſhewing to the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come,</hi> or as ſome tranſlation reads it, <hi>But to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to come, we will ſhew the praiſes of the Lord, his power alſo, and the wonderful works that he hath done:</hi> parallel to this is that, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.7. <hi>I will mention the loving kindneſſes of the Lord, and the promiſes of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath beſtowed on us, and the great goodneſs to the houſe of Iſrael: Memorare faciam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Azkir.</note> I will improve my care and intereſt, that the mercies of the Lord may be kept up in the minds and memories of his people; ſo the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8, 9, 10. <hi>We would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble, which came to us in</hi> Aſia, <hi>that we were preſſed out of meaſure above our ſtrength, inſomuch that we diſpaired even of life: But we had the ſentence of death in our ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves; but in God, which raiſed the dead: who delivered us from ſo great a death, and doth deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in whom we truſt that he will yet deliver us.</hi> What a hyſtory of his perſonal dangers and deliverances doth he make, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. to the end: That to commemorate and communicate the mercies of God, is our duty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, becauſe it is of divine eſtabliſhment; it is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God himſelf; he hath not left it Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor is it a meer humane conſtitution, but it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the great Law-giver, ſo that to fail in the duty is a tranſgreſſion of his law, and faſtens guilt upon the ſoul: And ſure 'tis the Saints wiſdom to take heed of ſin, and to comply with the whole minde of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.7, 8, 9. obſerve alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.5, 6. <hi>He eſtabliſhed a teſtimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Iſrael, which he commanded
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:151446:85"/>our fathers:</hi> Here is a law eſtabliſhed, and a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given to inforce the obſervance of it: here's the people pointed out, upon whom the obligation of this law taketh hold, and here's the explanation of this law, what it imports, to wit, <hi>That they ſhould not hide, but ſhew forth the wonderful works which the Lord hath done;</hi> and that not onely to their brethren, whoſe lives might probably be finiſhed as ſoon as theirs, and ſo the remembrance of thoſe great things might dy alſo, but to their children, who according to the courſe of nature, might live to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the memorial of them, when their carcaſſes were mouldred unto duſt: As the great works of God, are not uſually the work of one generation onely, but begun in one and compleated in another; ſo God would not have them be the wonder of one generation onely, he would not have one age wear out the remembrance of thoſe great deliverances, upon which he hath laid out ſo much of his wiſdom, power, mercy, goodneſs, juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their children muſt know them, nay the children which were yet unborn muſt hear of them, nay it muſt not ſtay here, but even they muſt ſtand up and declare them to their children, and ſo a careful remembrance muſt be kept up of mercies, by a ſucceſſion of ages, until time be ſwallowed up into eternity: much of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>overs inſtitution, had an eye to perpetuate the memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of Iſraels <hi>Exodus</hi> out of Egypt; ſo the golden pot of Manna, the twelves ſtones ſet up at the brink of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and many other things were the appointment of God, as ſtanding records of ſome glorious mercy; which fully ſpeak forth the mind of God, that he would have his people, report his acts of kindneſs and good will unto them.</p>
            <p>O then be exhorted to the practice of this duty! the fruits it bringeth forth are very precious.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Fruit. <hi>It will bring a Saint into more acquaintance with God;</hi> the ſoul hereby comes to a more experimental knowledge of God, when he beholds the banner of love diſplayed over him, and conſiders thoſe precious attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:151446:85"/>of mercy, goodneſs, wiſdom, and power, which were engaged for him, in the day of his diſtreſs: Oh! this begets more heart-familiarity; and makes a ſervant of the Lord more earneſt in his enquiries after God: as it is among men, when a man is brought into great ſtraights, either for eſtate or life, and a ſtranger takes pity on him, and through many difficulties, procures ſafety and dilive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for him. Oh how great a ſence of this kindneſs will be upon the ſpirit of an ingenuous perſon: how will he be often ſpeaking of it! and the more he thinks and ſpeaks of it, the more earneſtly will he deſire to know the man, that hath done ſuch great things for him: Juſt ſo it will be with a good man when he hath been in a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitous condition, knew not what to do nor which way to turn him, <hi>Refuge failed him, no man cared for his ſoul, he looked on his right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know him,</hi> as was <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.4. Nay farther, his brethren were far from him, his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance utterly eſtranged, his kinsfolks failed him, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar friends forgot him, his own ſervants counted him for a ſtranger, <hi>Nay his breath was ſtrange to his own wife, as was Jobs caſe,</hi> Job 19.13, 14, 15, 16, 17. when a Saint hath been brought to theſe exigents, and then the Lord hath come in, brought him off with his own arm, hath brought ſalvation to him: Oh what a ſence of mercy will this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get: How will a Saint awak his glory to ſpeak of this? How will he bewail his ignorance of God and follow on to know the Lord? How will he preſs after a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acquaintance with the Lord, who hath done ſuch great things for him; when <hi>Moſes</hi> was fled into <hi>Midian,</hi> and beheld the flaming buſh on mount Horeb, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.3. He ſaid, <hi>I will turn aſide and ſee this great ſight, why the buſh is not burnt:</hi> he contemplated the power and omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God in it, and what farther meaning the Lord had in that great miracle, and when the Lord had ſpake with and commiſſioned him to bring the children of Iſrael out of Egypt, he enquires into the name of that God, who proffers ſo far on the behalf of an afflicted people
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:151446:86"/>verſ. 13. and would not ſit down, untill God had told him that his name was, <hi>I AM THAT I AM,</hi> or I will be what I will be, <hi>Eheieh,</hi> being the ſame with <hi>Jah</hi> and <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which imply,</p>

            <p>Thirdly, Such a God as is true and conſtant in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: ready to make good whatſoever he hath ſpoken; nay, when <hi>Moſes</hi> had been upon the mount with God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days ank forty nights, <hi>And the Lord had ſpoke unto him face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to his friend,</hi> Exod. 33.11. yet having experienced ſo much the power and wiſdom of God, and having brought forth the children of Iſrael, by ſo many ſigns and wonders out of Egypt, and all by the immediate commands, and communications of God himſelf; he could not reſt in that knowledge of God he had already attained, but goes higher <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>And beſeecheth God to ſhew him his glory,</hi> he would not ſtay a little until he came to heaven, which could not be long, his glaſs being now almoſt run out, but he would have a full viſion of God in all his glory here, he would know all, and a great deal more then frail man was capable to know, of that God from whom he and his people had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch glorious, ſuch eminent deliverances: Oh ſure if people did more obſerve, and count over the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, Perſonal and National, there would not be ſuch a dedolent ignorance of God as there is; God would not be ſuch a ſtranger in our hearts, houſes, towns and countries: Ah, how many houſes may a man come into, nay how many towns may he rid through, and meet with very few, that know any thing of God to purpoſe, or that can give any conſiderable account of him, though his appearances of late have been ſo glorious amongſt us: Oh that of Iſrael is ſadly true of <hi>England,</hi> Iſa. 1.3. <hi>The Ox knoweth his owner, and the Aſs his maſters crib: but Iſrael hath not known, my people hath not underſtood;</hi> The Lord
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:151446:86"/>heal this great ignorance, and pardon it, and quicken up all to keep up a ſenſe of thoſe great things God hath done for us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Fruit. This frequent diſcourſing of mercies, healing, redeeming, quickning, and ſoul-converting mercies, &amp;c. <hi>will more endear God unto the Saints, it will unite the heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a more holy affection unto God,</hi> Cant. 8. verſ. 5. When the Church came out of the Wilderneſs leaning upon her Beloved; when Chriſt was with her in the Deſart, and brought her forth from a wilderneſs, where ſhe was at loſs in her ſelf, which way to go, and what to do how to get her wants ſupplied, how to have her life ſecured, how to get her feet directed, and how to free her ſelf from thoſe briars and thorns wherewith ſhe was intangled, and Chriſt had then come in, had born her up upon everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Arms, and had brought her forth into the plain field; Oh, how is ſhe affected with this! at what a pitch of love doth her ſpirit ſoar! how doth ſhe preſs upon Chriſt! how would ſhe get into the heart of Chriſt, and bring Chriſt into hers! verſ. 6. ſhe puts up this requeſt unto him, <hi>Set me as a ſeal upon thy heart, for love is ſtrong as death,</hi> which conquers all men, <hi>jealouſie is cruel as the grave,</hi> which ſpares none, and is never ſatisfied, <hi>the coals whereof are coals of fire, which have a moſt vehement flame, many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it, if a man would give all the ſubstance of his houſe for love, it would be utterly contemned;</hi> What a Pyramid of love is here? What an unquenchable flame? What a pearl of great price is here? and what is the fuel of this great fire? What oyle doth kindle it? and what preſerves it? Surely a ſtrong and lively ſenſe of Chriſts great affection to her, when in the wilderneſs: So, were our thoughts and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſings more upon wilderneſs-grace, wilderneſs-convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, wilderneſs-illightenings, wilderneſs-preſervations and wilderneſs-deliverances, our hearts would be more heated with holy affections towards God, then they are: Oh ſure! If there be any water at the bottome of the Well, this Bucket will draw it up, if any love in the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:151446:87"/>heart, ſenſe of mercies will bring it forth, and the more we diſcourſe of mercies, the greater will be our ſenſe of them.</p>
            <p>Nay farther, a ſerious pondering of, and a ſavoury diſcourſing over mercies received, will bring forth a ſtrong affiance in the people of God, it will marvellouſly ſcatter thoſe fears, and deſponding thoughts, which too often ſeize upon the beſt in a day of diſtreſs, and will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently prevail with the heart, to bring it off from creature-ſhiftings and ſeekings to ſtay upon God: <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation worketh patience, and patience experience;</hi> we ſhould never ſo fully experience the power, providence, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and faithfulneſs of God, if we ſhould alwayes ſail upon a quiet ſea, if our eſtate was ever proſperous, if the ſcale of adverſity were not ſometimes the heavier; but when we are caſt upon rough and rocky ſeas, when we are brought into ſtreights and know not what to do; why then we ſee what a God can do; what bowels, mercies, and tender-heartedneſs there is in a good God toward us: Alas men as men (and the beſt men are but men ſometimes, and in ſome caſes) are apt to fancy God to be like themſelves, as ſtreight-hearced and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate as themſelves to perſons in diſtreſs: but now, when an adverſe condition hath put it to the trial, then they have found it otherwiſe, <hi>That as high as the heaven is above the earth, ſo great is his mercy toward them that fear him,</hi> Pſal. 103. ver. 11. Nay as the <hi>heavens are higher than the earth, ſo are Gods wayes</hi> wayes of mercy to his afflicted ones, higher than mans wayes: And his thoughts, thoughts of goodneſs and good will to his oppreſſed ones, above mans thoughts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. verſ. 9. Now this experience work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hope, hope of ſuccour and relief from the Lord in an evill day; this works an holy boldneſs in the Saints, makes them lift up their heads and hearts with comfort, and ſay, Supplies will come; Deliverance will come, we will ſtand ſtill, and wait for the ſalvation of our God.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:151446:96"/>are precious, and carefully preſerved by the ſpirit, and when they put forth, it may be without any noiſe: <hi>For the Kingdom of heaven doth not always come with obſervation: Thus</hi> Timothy <hi>knew the holy Scriptures from a child,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15. not onely the bare letter and form of words, thats but little; but knew them ſo as to love them, to read them with delight, and look for ſalvation: wiſdom in them, <hi>through faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and probably by the care of his grandmother <hi>Lois</hi> and his mother <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice:</hi> ſure, gracious parents, and godly education do contribute much (though not infallibly) to the ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of tender years, and it was well if parents would make it much their care (as bleſſed be God ſome do) to furniſh their children, whileſt children, with Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.

            <p>Before this my Apoſtacy, I had free acceſs unto the throne of grace, I could come with humble and holy boldneſs unto God, and pour out my ſoul before him: ſuch a chamber, ſuch a cloſet can witneſs it; but now I have no heart to pray, ye I muſt be haled to it: merely conſcience pulleth me to it: yea, every time I go by that very cloſet, where I was wont to have that acceſs to the throne of Grace, it ſtrikes a terrour to my heart; I can never come into Gods preſence, but it is out of ſlaviſh fear; <hi>Oh it was better with me then, then it is now.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Before, Oh the ſweet communion my ſoul enjoyed with Jeſus Chriſt! one dayes communion with him, how much better was it, then the enjoyment of all the world! but now Jeſus Chriſt is a ſtranger to me, and I a ſtranger unto him: Before, Oh thoſe ſweet enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that my ſoul had in the Ordinances of God! when I came to the word, my ſoul was refreſhed, was warmed, my heart was enlightened: when I came to the Sacrament, oh the ſweetneſs that was there! and to prayer with the people of God, it was even an heaven upon earth unto me, but it is otherwiſe now, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God are dead and emptie things to me: <hi>Oh it was better with me then, then it is now.</hi>—</p>

            <p>Before, in all creatures I could enjoy God, I taſted the ſweetneſs and love of God, even in my meat and drink: I could ſit with my wife and children, and ſee God in them, and look upon the mercies of God through them, as a fruit of the Covenant of Grace; Oh how

Reaſon. <hi>Becauſe man in a ſtate of nature, is under ſuch an impotency and weakneſs, which rendereth a perfect obedience unto the Law of works, impoſſible unto him:</hi> He was ſo wounded and weakened by his fall, his bones were ſo ſhattered and broken, and out of joynt, that there remains no ſtrength at all in him; as, ſuppoſe a man ſhould fall from an high ſcaffold upon the hard ſtones, and ſuppoſe his life ſhould by a providential miracle be preſerved, yet his leggs and armes, and back-bones, and all, ſhould be broken and disjointed, a total diſlocation of all bones: Alas, what ſtrength would there be in this man for labour? what ſervice would he be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form? he would not be able to ſtirre hand or foot, to do any work; thus was it with man in his fall, upon a ſpiritual account, it was an exceeding high tower that he fell from, he was ſeated in an eſtate, but <hi>a little lower then the Angels,</hi> placed in Paradiſe, created in a ſtate of holineſs, and innocency, bearing the image of his maker, drawn out in lively characters upon his ſoul; all which ſpeak his primitive and firſt eſtate, to have been a glorious and raiſed condition, the falling from which muſt needs enervate his ſoul, yea break all his bones in peices: Hence the Apoſtle ſpeaking of man in his lapſed eſtate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. Verſ. 6. affirmes him to be <hi>without ſtrength,</hi> and of himſelf ſpeaks, Chap. 7. ver. 18. <hi>I know, that in me, that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:151446:104"/>is in my fleſh,</hi> as I am a ſon of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and as my nature ſtands in him under the fall, <hi>there dwelleth no good thing,</hi> nor habitual inclinations to that which is really and ſavingly good, that he intends this, will be evident, if we conſider what he ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. ver. 5. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing, as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God, who worketh in us both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. and wherefore doth God work both to will and to do, but becauſe we are able neither to will nor to do in our own ſtrength? for alas! the Law could not do, could not anſwer the demands of God, and why? <hi>in that it was weak through the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.2, 3. or in that, man weakened by the fall was not able to bring forth perfect righteouſneſs by his obedience to the Law; now then, if the root and power of thinking, willing, and doing any thing that is good, be not in our nature, but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally wrought in us by grace; how much leſs are we able, of our ſelves by any connate principles or abilities, to yield perfect obedience to the Law, without which there can be no ſalvation in the way of the firſt Covenant.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Reaſon. Becauſe, as man ſtands in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and in the firſt Covenant, <hi>he is born a childe of wrath, under the indignation of a juſt and righteous God,</hi> Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. ver. 3. <hi>And were by nature children of wrath, Deires, damnati priuſquam nati,</hi> condemned before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note>now then, if we be born children of wrath, it muſt be by nature, or by grace; not by grace, therefore by nature: and if by nature, then either by nature cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> or by nature renewed in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> not by nature renovated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore it followes, that by nature corrupted in the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath; for the firſt man (by his fall) corrupted the whole nature, and now nature thus corrupted pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteth every man; as a garment infected by the plague, ſpreads a contagion through the whole body of a ſound man, who puts it on whileſt the infection abides is it;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:151446:104"/>Hence <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Adam,</hi> an hundred and thirty years after his fall,) ſuppoſing he fell in the ſame day wherein he was created (begat <hi>Seth,</hi> in his own likeneſs, after his image, in reſpect both of corruption, and liableneſs to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: for if that phraſe <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. verſ. 26, 27. God ſaid, <hi>Let us make man in our image, after our likeneſs,</hi> is to be expounded by that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. verſ. 24. <hi>That ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and holineſs of truth,</hi> as ſurely in part it is, then <hi>Adam</hi>'s begetting a ſon in his own likeneſs, after his image, muſt needs imply his communicating his corrupt nature by generation unto him, which is the old man, corrupt according to the deceitfull luſts, in the Apoſtles language, and ſo originall ſinne is not by imitation onely, but by propagation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This then ſhew's the Saints how little beholding they are to old <hi>Adam,</hi> for thoſe ſpiritual attainments they have arrived at; that thoſe gracious habits and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the ſoul, whereby they are carried out in their deſires and affections, after that which is good, were not the Legacies and bequeathments of their firſt parents; much leſs are thoſe principles and that power whereby they are enabled to act and do, what is well-pleaſing to God, an eſtate of inheritance deſcended upon them from Grand-ſire <hi>Adam;</hi> all the Saints may ſpeak the words of <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah, Is there yee any portion or inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance for us in our fathers houſe? for he hath ſold us, and quite devoured our money,</hi> Gen. 32. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15. This is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true upon a ſpiritual and ſaying account, being applied by believers to their ſtanding in the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> as if a Merchant ſhould have a great ſtock given him by his father, and ſhould at his firſt ſetting up, drive on a very full trade, but afterwards, through his own improvidence and careleſneſs, ſhould be ſuch a Bankrupt, that he had not one penny left, either to help himſelf, or to leave his Son; and yet his ſon through the bounty of a noble friend is furniſhed with a trading ſtock, and grows wealthier then ever his father was, trades
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:151446:105"/>upon ſurer tearms then ever his father did; whom may the ſon thank for all this? his father or his friend? Thus it was with <hi>Adam,</hi> and thus it is with believers, as you may eaſily make out, if ye proſecute the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance in your own thoughts; they may truly ſay with <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32. ver. 10. <hi>with my ſtaff I paſſed over this Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, and now I am become two bands:</hi> That Gold where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are made rich, above the wealth of <hi>Croeſus,</hi> yea of both the Indies, they have not out of old <hi>Adams</hi> coffers: That <hi>white raiment,</hi> fine and clean, which covers the ſhame of their nakedneſs, and renders them more glorious then <hi>Solomon in all his glory,</hi> comes not out of old <hi>Adams</hi> wardrobe; and that <hi>eye-ſalve,</hi> the anointing wherewith gives light and ſight far above the enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Jonathan, when he had taſted that honey-dew with the tip of his rod,</hi> is not taken out of old <hi>Adams</hi> gallipots; no, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3. verſ. 18.

This alſo fully evinceth this truth, <hi>That eternal life is the free gift of God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſhews the Saints, whom to own, as the fountain of life and light in them, and to them, to wit, the God of all Grace, by whoſe, diſcriminating grace in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>They are appointed not unto wrath, but to obtain ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.9. <hi>who of God is made unto us, wiſdome, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and Redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 30.

            <p n="1">1. That the word of God is the walk of Chriſts ſheep, the Scriptures of truth ſet boundaries to their Paſtures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Every departure from the word in judgement or practice is an aberration; the ſheep that ſeek paſture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bound of Scripture are ſtraglers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the ſheep of Chriſt, eſpecially the fat and luſty of them, are apt to wander; to go beyond their bounds, and in ſomethings, to depart from their flock and fold, but I would not be miſtaken, as though I interpret the departure of conſcientious Chriſtians, from the common road of carnal Goſpeling, or from the foot track of formal profeſſion; nor yet their declining communion with the whole rout of profeſſors at large in that peculiar Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Supper, to be a departure from the flock and fold of Chriſt; for, in this their breathing after Goſpel-purity, they walk agreably to a Goſpel-rule;
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.11. Cha. 10.16, 17.</note> but when a people run into deſtructive errors, and take up opinions or practices, inconſiſtent with the truth and holineſs of the Goſpel; this I call a wandering from the flock and fold of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When ſheep begin to wander, and are got out of their uſual walk, ſo inobſervant are they, that they ſtraggle over all mountains and hills, and know not where to ſtay, nor how to return home again, how ſadly and how often hath this been evidenced in our days? what errors new or old have not been taken up and entertained by ſome of the Nation? how have ſome wandered from mountain to hill, and knew not where to fit down? and how far have they ſtraggled out of their knowledge, that they knew not how to get back again?</p>
            <pb n="174" facs="tcp:151446:118"/>
            <p n="5">5. That wandering ſheep become meat to every beaſt of prey; ſingle ſheep and ſilly ſheep, when they are from under the care and overſights of their keepers can hardly ſave themſelves by flight or fight from the evening wolves; how ſuddainly have many been caught in our days, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.6.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That there are many beaſts of prey, which lay wait for wandering ſheep to devour them; Foxes and Wolves have been always ſtirring, and are not many now a days? Wolves in ſheeps cloathing, who have cunningly dreſt up their opinions with ſuch an Evangelical trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that nothing of the Wolf appears, even to them which hold him by the ears.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That it is much blame-worthy in ſhepherds, when they ſuffer their ſheep to go aſtray, and run themſelves into danger: the Lord chargeth high, as a piece of great unfaithfulneſs in the over-ſeers of his flock, when through their default his ſheep do ſtraggle, and become a prey to the beaſt of the field: you may hear him expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf in words of greateſt diſtaſt. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.10. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God Adonai Jehovah, or Jehovah who is your Lord, behold I am againſt the ſhepherds, and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire my flock at their hands, and cauſe them to ceaſe feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my flock:</hi> tis known to moſt, that in Scripture-lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, Magiſtrates and Miniſters are termed ſhepherds, and have in their reſpective capacities, a joint over-ſight of the flock committed unto them by the chief ſhepherd; but alas! how have ye Magiſtrates ſhuffled off the care of the flock to the Miniſters? and how have the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhifted back the over-ſight of it to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates? and betwixt them both, many ſheep have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and ſome have been worried: Though moſt were deſirous that the Foxes ſhould be taken, yet it came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diſpute, who ſhould take them; and though at all hands it was agreed, that deceiving <hi>Jezebel</hi> ſhould be dealt withal, yet how and by whom, hath hitherto been the queſtion: Ask the Magiſtrate and he will tell you Miniſters muſt do it by the ſword of the ſpirit: and ask
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:151446:118"/>the Miniſter and he will tell you that the Magiſtrate muſt do it by the ſword of his civil power: And whilſt we have been diſputing what to do, and who ſhould do it, errors have ſadly ſpread, and a conſiderable part of the flock hath ſtraggled, and is become a prey to the beaſts of the field: the blame whereof is laid by ſome at the Magiſtrates door, upon account of his tenderneſs and gentleneſs of ſpirit, and countenance to ſuch as differed onely in diſciplinary points, refuſing to eſtabliſh by his civil ſanction, that way of diſcipline, as univerſal and impoſing upon all, which they own, and would enthrone as the government of the Lord Jeſus: as alſo for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſs and too much indulgence to evil perſons and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, in not puniſhing the one nor ſuppreſſing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which amounteth to a toleration: And many charge the blame hereof upon the Miniſtry, by reaſon of moroſe, auſtere, and rigid carriage toward thoſe, who differ from them in the way of diſcipline, or onely in ſome leſſer doctrines, that are not fundamental; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they remit much of that care, watchfulneſs and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight, which the duty of their places, and the preſent neceſſity obliged them unto, but the day will declare it: and tis not good for either to plead not guilty: the Lord help us to mourn, that the folds are broken up, and that the flocks are ſcattered: The Lord teach us all our duty, and by his own ſpirit in the word, determine that great queſtion, what is to be done, and by whom; <hi>That the ſick may be healed, the broken bound up, the loſt may be ſought up, thoſe that are driven away may be brought again, and the reſidue ſecured againſt future ſcattering:</hi> And the Lord give ſtability of ſpirit to his people, that they may be kept from topling in theſe tottering times, when ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny backſlide, ſome in profeſſion not in opinion, ſome in opinion who yet retain a profeſſion, and ſome in opinion and profeſſion both, ſtepping into Religion without any precedaneous and inward change, and ſo ſoon in, ſoon out; making that good 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19. <hi>They went out from us becauſe they were not of us:</hi> And now, you will finde, upon
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:151446:119"/>due trial, this an excellent means to fix your ſpirits, when you read over thoſe acts of grace, which the Lord hath drawn out upon your hearts in the blood of his own Son: How did this fix the Apoſtles, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.67. <hi>Many of the diſciples went back, and walked no more with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> upon which he puts the queſtion to them, <hi>will yee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo forſake me?</hi> there was need of ſuch a queſtion: for, <hi>Nemo errat ſibi-ipſi,

            <p n="1">1. You that are experienced Chriſtians may much underprop a timorous and faint-hearted Profeſſour in dayes of Perſecution; when his fears are great, his dangers many, and his courage low: Have you not heard a ſervant of the Lord, ſadly ſpeaking this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, I expect every hour an Apparitour, or Purſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaunt, to fetch me to the Court or Counſel; But I fear I ſhall wrong the cauſe and Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, in that I ſhall not be able <hi>to give an anſwer to them that ask me, a reaſon of the hope that is in me,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. nor repel the ſubtil arguments, which will be drawn up againſt the Truth, and thereby ſhall bring ſhame upon
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:151446:127"/>my ſelf, reproach upon Religion, and diſhonour to the Lord Jeſus. Now if an experienced Chriſtian ſhall reply, Is this thy fear? do ſuch thoughts as theſe ſadden thy ſpirit? come, cheer up man; this is a path that I have troden; I have been called out to bear witneſs to the truth, before as learned ſubtil Inquiſitours as theſe be, and was under much trouble what to ſay, and how to anſwer, being then low in knowledg, and weak in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but I found that promiſe made good unto me, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. ver. 15. <hi>I will give you a mouth and wiſdome, which all your adverſaries ſhall not be able to gainſay or reſiſt;</hi> I was ſupplyed from on high both with Invention and Elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I might ſay with <hi>Luther, Neſcio unde veniunt iſtae meditationes;</hi> I know not whence thoſe Arguments, Anſwers, and Objections came; but ſure, it was the Spirit of my Father which ſpake in me, and the Promiſe is univerſal, to all the Saints, when brought to a day of trial; How bravely did <hi>Anne Aſcue, Alice Driver,</hi> and other poor women, anſwer the Doctours, and put them to a <hi>nonplus?</hi> Fear not then, <hi>For it ſhall be given you in that ſame hour, what you ſhall ſpeak,</hi> Matth. 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>A Second Complaint of a poor Chriſtian is this; I have wife and children to take care for, my heart goes out exceeding much unto them, it goes very near me, to bring them into an eſtate of want and povertie; and therefore I much fear, that I ſhall grudge exceedingly to ſuffer a confiſcation of mine Eſtate for conſcience ſake; I ſhall be loath to draw up mine own will in mine own bloud, and give away all mine Eſtate from my dear relations, that ſtrangers ſhall inherit my labours, and the children of mine own body ſhall be turned out of doors: a ſad tryal! enough to daſh thoſe generous ſpirits of the Goſpel, in that heart, where fleſh and bloud are conſulted with: But now if an experienced believer ſhall take him to task, and tell him in the word of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; O friend, this was my caſe; I had a fair inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance deſcended upon me, had much improved it by

O how may the Saints of God, in all theſe caſes, mutually contribute to the comforting, councelling, ſupporting, and edifying each other in their <hi>moſt holy faith,</hi> if they would be free in communicating their experiences to one another, and more frequent in holding up communion one with another: The wiſe man tells us, <hi>As Iron ſharpeneth Iron, ſo a man ſharpeneth the countenance of his friend;</hi> the point of moſt Chriſtian zeal is very blunt; they are ſharp enough in cenſures, and contentions, to draw blood of the credit, yea the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of their brethren: But what edge would be ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their zeal in the beſt ſenſe, and for the beſt things, if they would often meet together in love, and ſharpen each other by holy conferrences? may not the neglect of Chriſtian communion rightly managed, be much a cauſe of our diviſions, and animoſities? and would it not be a healing means, as to love and union amongſt the Saints? would it not procure a right underſtanding to prevent Schiſms and parties? would it not meeken the ſpirits of diſſenting brethren? would it not daſh thoſe hot vapors, which fly up into the heads of many, and diſtemper their brains with notions and niceties? and may it not through the bleſſing of God, have an hopefull tendency to the quickening, comforting, confirming, and ſpiritualizing the Saints, the whole Nation over? <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Then</hi> (in a time bad enough, and it may be, much worſe then ours, whatſoever ſome men ſay) <hi>they that feared the Lord, ſpake often one to another, and the Lord hearkened and heard, and a book of remembrance was writ before the Lord, for thoſe that feared him and thought upon his name,</hi> &amp;c. What an encouraging practice of the Saints and promiſe of the Lord is here, to quicken us up to a ſuitable carriage? we have had much talk of Claſſical Aſſemblies, of teaching and ruling Elders to advance the diſcipline of Chriſt: O that we might have (bear the word, and blame not the wiſh) Claſſical communions of Miniſters, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,

How ſhall we anſwer the charge of our own conſciences at a dying hour? how ſhall we look our dear Redeemer in the face at the laſt day? nay how ſhall we ſtand againſt the great accuſer before the great <hi>tribunal,</hi> when he ſhall charge this ſpirituall ſloth and negligence upon us? when he ſhall ſpeak to the Judge of all the world, and cry for juſtice againſt us, urging that his ſervants have been more faithfull and ſerviceable to him, then we have been to the Lord Jeſus, though he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bled to redeem them, never underwent the wrath of a ſin-revenging God for them, never laid down his life to ſave them out of hell, never gave them inward and heart conſolations here, neither prepared for, nor ever promiſed unto them, a ſtate of everlaſting bleſſedneſſe, <hi>and fulneſſe of joy in his preſence forevermore</hi> hereafter: and therefore ſhall call for ſentence to be given out againſt us, as being unworthy of that <hi>crown of glory:</hi> O this is a conſideration of great weight, the Lord help us to take the right poiſe of it; let us take ſhame unto our ſelves for our former negligence, and be quickened up to more induſtriouſneſſe for the future! Let not any of the devils drudges out-work us, nor any of his merchants out-bid us, much leſſe any of his pedlers out-ſell us for the time to come; let not others do more to undo, then we to ſave ſouls, nor be more unwearied in their labours and travells to pervert, then we are to convert men; if there be a perſon that deſerves, as a badge of honour, the name of that old Diſciple, trudge o're the world, let not Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite and Heretick get it from us.</p>

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:151446:152"/>upon a ſpiritual account, then now there is: How did the old Puritans of <hi>England</hi> cling together? what ſincere heartedneſs of affection was there among them? how would they owne one another in Courts, and Conventicles, and hug a brother, notwithſtanding all the dirt which was caſt upon him? but we are grown ſo fine-fingered now, that we will not touch a ſoiled gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo neat in our dreſs, that we will nor ſuffer a ſpot upon our coat for Chriſt: It were well if we were ſo curious in Saint <hi>James</hi> his ſenſe, <hi>to keep our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted from the world</hi> Jam. 1. <hi>ver.ult.</hi> or in <hi>Jude's</hi> ſence, next <hi>to hate the garments ſpotted with the fleſh,</hi> Jude, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. nay farther, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. ver. 34. <hi>ye had compaſſion of me in my bonds,</hi> relieved an impriſoned and a ſilenced Miniſter: How did good Chriſtians think it their honour, to be <hi>Gaiusſes,</hi> and entertainers of good Miniſters? Nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>ye took joyfully the ſpoiling of your goods;</hi> this hath been made good alſo among us: and how chearfully did Chriſtians carry on their Profeſſion under theſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: as when the hand of the Lord is upon a family, or town, if the ſound and healthfull ſee that the deceaſed recover, and that the ſickneſs is not mortall, this takes off much of that fear which began to ſeize upon them; they keep their dwellings, and adminiſter not unto the ſick, in like manner, when perſecution ſtriketh at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Chriſtians, and <hi>the Lord ſtayeth the rough winde of fire and faggot; in that day of his eaſt winde, and that it is in meaſure, not exceeding liberty,</hi> or ſome leſs penalties; others do keep their ground, and ſhrink not from their colours: Oh lay up this Confideration, as a cordial by you, when the fear of perſecutions begets a fainting in you: and as Jeſus Chriſt ſaid concerning <hi>Lazarus</hi> his diſtemper, <hi>John</hi> 11. ver. 4. <hi>This ſickneſs is not unto death, but for the glory of God, and that the ſon of God may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed thereby:</hi> So when troubles, and perſecutions ariſe, believe, and comfort your ſelves in this, that they ſhall not be unto death, but for the <hi>glory of God, and that the ſon of God might be glorifyed by them.</hi> Thus, when the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:151446:153"/>Lord had given in <hi>Peter,</hi> as an anſwer of the Churches prayers, in ſo ſignal a manner, and had ſmote the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutour, with ſuch a remarkable hand of Divine venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance <hi>Acts</hi> 12. ver. 24. <hi>The word of God grew and multiplied:</hi> the ſeed lay a while buried under earth, and the blade that began to put out, was a little nip'd, and hung the head: <hi>Hered</hi>'s perſecution was a blaſting wind and froſt; it did a little ſtock the wheat, and made it change the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: but when <hi>Peter</hi> was delivered, and <hi>Herod</hi> deſtroyed; whoſe death was rather, <hi>precationis opus quam morbi,</hi> the fruit of the Churches ſeeking, then his own ſickneſs, as was ſaid of <hi>Arius</hi> the Heretick, who was prayed to death by <hi>Alexander,</hi> that good Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople: then the word grew,</hi> not onely the blade, but to the ear, yea, to the ripe wheat in the ear; Knowledg grew, Faith grew, Hope grew, Profeſſion grew, Godlineſs grew, and Comfort grew: nay, the Word did not onely magnifie in the hearts of thoſe, where it was rooted already, but even multiplied in the Converſion of many others, theſe gracious actings of cuſtodient mercy, being as the warm ſun, and growing ſhowers unto the earth: Thus, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. ver. 12. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Philippian</hi> brethren, <hi>that the things which happened unto him</hi> [viz.] the troubles and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the Goſpel,</hi> they helped forward the Goſpel in the fruitfull Profeſſion of it, and he gives this as an evidence of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>becauſe many of the brethren of the Lord walked more confident by his bonds, and became much more bold to ſpeak the word without fear: at his firſt anſwer before Nero, no man ſtood with him, but all forſook him;</hi> the brethren were cow'd and creaſt-fallen, ſtood alooff off, as fearing the rage of that cruel Tyrant, who <hi>orientem fidem Romae cruentavit,</hi> embrued the riſing Goſpel with the bloud of its Profeſſours, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting a bloudy decree, that whoſoever confeſſed himſelf, to be a Chriſtian, ſhould be put to death, as a convicted enemy of mankind: Hence he is called by one, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatour of the condemnation of Chriſtians: But when they ſay, that <hi>the Lord ſtood by him, and delivered him out
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:151446:153"/>of the mouth of the Lion,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. and that he had obtained, <hi>liberam cuſtodiam,</hi> freedome to go abroad with his keeper; nay, that he had hired an houſe in <hi>Rome,</hi> and received all that came unto him; <hi>preaching the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and teaching thoſe things which concerned the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with all confidence, no man forbidding him;</hi> that he was neither ſlain, or ſhut up, nor yet ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: then they took courage, and not onely profeſſed, but <hi>preached the Goſpel without fear,</hi> and ſcattered that precious ſeed within the walls of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s pallace. Thus the Lord governs the ſufferings of his people, when not unto bloud, to the <hi>ſtrengthening of weak hands, which hand down, and the feeble knees, and to the making of ſtreight paths for their feet, that the lame are not turned out of the way, but rather healed,</hi> Heb. 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13. There's much heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy to weak believers, who like <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> are lame of their feet, as to profeſſion, and are apt to get a wrench in rough wayes, when the Lord ſtayes the rage of men, and brings off his ſuffering Saints, with ſafety both of cask and conſcience. Lay up this Conſideration againſt a day of tryal: And let me add further,</p>
            <p n="4">4. That if the Lord ſhould leave you in the hands of bloody perſecutours, and ſhould give them a full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, not onely againſt your liberties, but your lives alſo, yet even your death would be life unto <hi>the dead, in a ſaving ſence unto others:</hi> this hath been often witneſſed, that <hi>ſanguis Martyrum eſt ſemen Eccleſiae,</hi> the blood of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs is the ſeed of the Church.

For their unjuſt charge of Hypocriſie upon them: who ſo envious as evil men? who are ſo much the objects of their envy as the godly are — and why is their malice ſo much againſt them? ſurely, it is upon the account of Religion, of differencing Grace and holineſs: This was the ſeed of the firſt quarrel betwixt man and man; this was that which made <hi>Cain</hi> a fratricide, and wherefore <hi>ſlew he his brother?</hi> becauſe <hi>his own works were evil, and his Brothers righteous,</hi> 1 John 3.12. and now, though the laws of men, and the power of God reſtrain wicked men from murdering the godly, yet they ſhed the bloud of their ſoules, and ſlay their ſincerity, by charging Hypocriſie upon them, which is the higheſt degree of murther, and that which the ſeed of <hi>Cain</hi> ſhall one day pay dearly for. But what makes them ſo bold to call the Saints Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites? what colour have they for ſuch a charge? or what ground have they, thus to traduce the ſincere ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord? why, the falſe gloſs they put upon

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:151446:165"/>if they can get but ſuch and ſuch a Doctour to their bed-ſides, they preſently conceit themſelves well, at leaſt, in a ſafe way for Recovery: This is a fault in both, whereby an encroachment is made upon God, and he robbed of his glory: may not that queſtion be put in this caſe, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.3. <hi>Is it not, becauſe there is no God in Iſrael, that ye go to enquire of Baal-zebub the God of Ekron?</hi> alas! <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf is but a <hi>Baal-zebub,</hi> as to the perfecting of any cure, without the bleſſed preſence of the God of Iſrael; <hi>Aſa</hi> ſinned, in truſting to the skill of an <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Phyſician, as well as <hi>Ahaziah</hi> in ſending to enquire of his recovery of the God of <hi>Ekron:</hi> 'tis dangerous to rely upon means, though the beſt of means; we are commanded, in trouble, to call upon God; but if we truſt in our prayers, or expect help and health from them, we ſin, and have little ground to expect ſafety: The ark was a ſigne of Gods preſence; and even <hi>Jordan</hi> it ſelf was fordable; when the feet of the Prieſts, who bare the Ark of the Covenant, came to the brink of the river; yet, when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in a defeature by the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> Army, imputed their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw to the abſence of the Ark, and therefore, ſent for the Ark into the camp; making the earth ring, with their loud acclamations of joy, at the approach of it, putting themſelves into the hazzard of a new battel, under the protection of that ſacred ſtandard; they made but a bad bargain, for they were again ſmitten with a very great ſlaughter, and the Ark of God taken, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.3. unto the 12 <hi>verſe.</hi> Much more might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to ſhew the danger of reſting upon man and means; but this hath been fully ſpoke to already, in a former Uſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If this be true; that God appears to the help of his people, in the day of their diſtreſs; then blame may be juſtly charged upon thoſe, who will not wait for help from God; who diſcover impaciency of ſpirit in an evil day, if help do not ſuddenly come, many men have paid dearly for it: <hi>Saul</hi> had much to ſay for
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:151446:165"/>himſelf, <hi>The Philiſtines were gathered againſt him in great numbers, Iſrael was ſcattered from him, and Samuel out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayed his time appointed,</hi> 1 Sam. 30.8. compared with 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10.8. and yet becauſe he waited not for help in Gods way, and at Gods time, <hi>Samuel</hi> tells him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>that he had done fooliſhly;</hi> — and <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>that his kingdome ſhould not continue;</hi> It is obſervable, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. that <hi>aſſoon as Saul had made an end of offering, behold, Samuel came;</hi> Such is Mans Imprudent raſhneſs, that he will not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail Gods pace, in the way of his own ſafety, but will whip and ſpur, and run full ſpeed in wayes of his own invention, though to his coſt; when as it ſometime, falls out, that, ſo ſoon as he hath made all things ready to have deliverance in his own way, <hi>Samuel</hi> comes; God appears, opens a door of ſafety to him, and in a certain way of Providence would have ſecured him againſt all his fears; but now, becauſe he waited not Gods time, the Lord refuſeth help, and his own devices periſh, and he with them: The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> have left this truth writ in the bloud of many of them, when they would not ſtay Gods leaſure, but would to <hi>Canaan</hi> upon their own legs. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.44. whereas, had they waited Gods time, he would have carried them thither in his own armes: <hi>Jehoram</hi> ſinned this way, when he broke out into ſuch high language, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. ult. <hi>Behold, this evil is of the Lord; what ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi> Oh, this is a very great evil; a teeming womb that brings forth many ill-favoured bratts:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Unbelief is the iſſue of impaciency; he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, doth not make haſte, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16.

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:151446:166"/>him and his wayes, if he be put to overmuch waiting.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Diſcontented murmurings are the products of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, if help comes not at the nick of time, when 'tis looked for, then men are apt to let fly in the very face of God: What petulancy and peeviſhneſs of ſpirit did Iſrael once and again diſcover in their murmurings in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the wilderneſs? and what was the ground of their quarrel? why, becauſe they were kept longer in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and longer out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> then they had a minde to ſtay: Hence the Apoſtle cautions the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Chriſtians to beware of this ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Neither murmur ye as ſome of them alſo murmured, and were destroyed of the deſtroyer;</hi> and then antidote's them againſt this diſtemper, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. Firſt, By aſſerting that affliction is the common lot and portion of all the Saints. Secondly, that no affliction of theirs was ſo ſignall and ſingular, but, that others have had the ſame. Thirdly, That God will ſupport his ſuffering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones under all their afflictions, he will bear up the weight of the building, with his own buttereſſes. Fourthly, That ſuccours and ſalvation will come from the Lord unto them, and therefore dehorts them from repining, and exhorts to a patient waiting for the Lord, in his own way, and at his own time.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When men are impatient under afflictions, they uſually ſtep aſide into unlawfull wayes, and ruſh upon unwarranted courſes: 'tis hard to retain an impatient Perſon from taſting the forbidden fruit; 'tis hard to keep his unruly ſpirit within the bounds of duty and obedience: <hi>Saul</hi> broke the bonds when <hi>Samuel</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayed his time; and therefore, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.9. he will needs wear a linnen Ephod, at leaſt, invade the Prieſts Office, in offering burnt-offerings, and hath his excuſe ready to ſhift off the blame, and palliate his offence, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. <hi>Becauſe that I ſaw, that the people were ſcattered from me, and that thou cameſt not within the dayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and that, the Philiſtines gathered themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Michmaſh; therefore ſaid I, the Philiſtines will
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:151446:166"/>come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made ſupplication unto the Lord: I forced my ſelf therefore, and offered a burnt offering.</hi> O then, take heed of impatiency, wait upon the Lord in your diſtreſſes, wait his time, and wait for help in his wayes: <hi>Do not limit the Holy One of Iſrael:</hi> Do not preoccupate the Lord, leſt <hi>you forſtall your own markets, and forſake your own mercies:</hi> This is recorded, as a provoking ſin in <hi>Iſrael, Pſal.</hi> 78.41. <hi>That they tempted God,</hi> and <hi>limited the Holy One of Iſrael; deſignarunt,</hi> they preſcribed to him, and ſet him bounds, which he muſt not paſs, and this was done. Firſt, By queſtioning his power, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>Can God help in ſuch a ſtraight? can God deliver from ſuch a diſtreſs?</hi> will the Lord make windows in Heaven, and rain down bread, to ſupply in ſo great a famine? as the unbelieving Noble-man ſuggeſted, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.1.— 2. God is limited, when his will is circumſcribed; as if he was bound to ſerve mens luſts: If <hi>Manna</hi> come to be loathed as light meat, Quailes muſt be ſent, though they die with the meat, in their mouthes, <hi>ver.</hi> 30, 31. — 3. When men appoint God, what means he ſhall uſe to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh and perfect their deliverance by: thus Iſrael will acquaint God, and herein limit him, that the onely means of their ſafety lay, <hi>in having a King to fight their battels for them,</hi> 1 Sam. 8.20. — 4. In limiting God his time; he muſt come in with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, as, in their wayes, ſo, in their time; and, if <hi>Jehovah</hi> miſs but a minute, if he out-ſtay the time deſigned by them, then they ſwell, look big, and grow impatient, and, with <hi>Jehoram, They will wait for the Lord no longer,</hi> 2 Kings 6.33. I, but ſee how Iſrael ſped for their limiting, and ſetting down bounds to the Lord, why, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 78.59, 60. <hi>When God heard this,</hi> their carnal arguings, ſinfull murmurings, and froward reſolutions, becauſe God would not ſerve their turns in every point, <hi>he was wroth, and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:151446:167"/>greatly abhorred Iſrael:</hi> Oh! 'tis a ſad thing to be a Perſon or People of Gods abhorrencie: therefore wait, and be ſilent: 'tis the Prophets counſel, and very ſeaſonable in the caſe propounded, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Be ſilent, O all fleſh before the Lord: for he is raiſed up out of his holy habitation.</hi>

This grand Conſideration, That God doth ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably and fully appear to the help of his people, in the day of their diſtreſs, drawes up a high charge againſt thoſe, who have experienced this truth, and do not keep up Records of their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, and preſervations; who retain not a ſenſe and remembrance of the great mercies of God towards them, neither give him the glory of them: It is a common ſaying, and grown proverbial; that <hi>Injuries are ingraven in braſs, but curteſies are written upon the ſands;</hi> wiſh, there was not a truth in this: It ſeems, it was true amongſt the Iſraelites, God had done them many a good turne, the Prophet gives a large Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of them, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.13. They ſoon forgat his works, they made haſt to forget them; they were waſh'd off with the next tide; they had the <hi>Lientery,</hi> which is a kind of Flux in the ſtomach, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, nor concocting the meat which is received, but for want of due heat, and a retentive quality in the ſtomack, the meat paſſeth ſuddenly away raw and undigeſted, and the parts of the body receive little or no nouriſhment from the choiſeſt food: Truely, moſt men have this ſpiritual <hi>Lientery;</hi> their memories are ſo fluid and ſlippery, that the choiceſt mercies and deliverances make but a little ſtay upon them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there a due proportion of that noble and ſacred heat, whereby they may be concocted and turned into ſpiritual Chyle, and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: How wan and weak, how crazy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive are many mens ſoules, notwithſtanding all thoſe-choice dainties of Providences, and Ordinances God hath ſpread their tables with! and whence is
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:151446:167"/>this leanneſs and liſtleſneſs? whence comes it, that the mercies of God bred no more noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpirits in many perſons? ſure it proceeds from that unhappy flux that moſt are ſubject unto: If we could retain a right ſence of eminent mercies upon our hearts, there would be a better concoction, we ſhould be more lively, and more ſpirituall in our returnes unto God, and in our actings for God: The Lord layes this much to heart, and it kindles great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure in him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.5, 6. The Lord rub's up <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s memory, and tells him, <hi>I did know thee in the wilderneſs, in the land of great drought,</hi> God knew them; Firſt, In reſpect of their ſinnes, to viſit for them: Secondly, In regard of their wants; to provide for them: The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of Gods Juſtice, and his Providence, whileſt Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el was in the wilderneſs ſpeaks fully to both theſe: A very large account may be given of the eminent and glorious acts of the Lords bounty and goodneſs to them, when they were in a low condition; Read Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> Notes upon the place; where he enumerates many; But now, when God had brought them through <hi>Jordan,</hi> and poſſeſſed them of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that <hi>they were filled, and filled</hi> (it is repeated,) <hi>in that freſh and fat paſture, their heart was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, and they forgot God;</hi> But how doth the Lord take this? why ſee, <hi>Therefore will I be unto them as a Lion, as a Leopard in the way, will I obſerve them, I will meet them as a Bear rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of her whelps</hi> (ſure there muſt needs be great diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, when the Father of mercies puts on the nature of ſuch fell and fierce beaſts) <hi>and I will rent the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a Lion;

Thoſe are reprooved, who, though they remember the mercies of God, tell large ſtories of their eminent preſervations, and ſeem to be much affected in reporting of them, which ſignifies little in Gods account, yet they do not live up unto them, they do not receive any teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them more to engage their hearts to God, but live as looſly, and as much off from God, as to any real actings for God, as though they were under no extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Obligation unto God, which is a brand upon them, and notes out a very diſ-ingenious and unworthy ſpirit. Vocal thankfulneſs is the leaſt part of gratitude; the whole man ſhould be wholly taken up in the duty, it is not the water which paſſeth through a ſingle ſpout, that will turn this great wheel, but the full ſtream, which through many pipes flowes from the fountain; <hi>All that is within me praiſe his holy name; David</hi> thought, the all of his ſoul in every faculty, little enough for that great work, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.4. nay, too little; and ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.9. he ſaies, <hi>I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living, indeſinenter ambulabo:</hi> I will not onely take a turn or two with God, but will walk conſtantly, to the end of the race, thorough the exerciſe of every grace, the faithfull diſcharge of every duty, the conſcionable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of every ſervice, yea, though all the Acts, and parts, and methods of Religion, and all this he engageth, as a Teſtimony of his thankfulneſs to God for eminent mercy, in that full and memorable deliverance, which he obtained happily, in the deſert of <hi>Maon.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.25, 26. When God fetched off <hi>Saul</hi> who had begirt <hi>David</hi> and his men, with his Army, where he was in eminent danger, to have been ſurpriſed, had not the Lord in way of ſeaſonable Providence alarum'd <hi>Saul</hi> by the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:151446:168"/>who then invaded the land: This was a right improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch a mercy: But alas! How few be there, who tread in <hi>David</hi>'s ſteps? who act up with ſuch reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and fixedneſs of ſpirit for God, under the ſence of admirable and obliging Providences? How little are Providences taken notice of? how little are they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by moſt, ſo as to quicken them up to more acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity for God? are there not many, who ſteal, murder, commit adultery, and ſwear faſly, as though they were delivered to do all theſe abominations? <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.9, 10. do they not act as high in waies of ſin as ever? It is with many in this point, as it is with ſome vapouring tradeſmen, who live and ſpend all in riot and luxury, till they are clap'd up by their Creditours; but when their friends have compounded for them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their enlargement, and given them a trading ſtock again, they promiſe fair, and fair, what good husbands they will be, and tuckle hard to their trades for a while; but within a ſhort ſpace, they forget their poverty, and impriſonment, and laſh out again as much as ever: ſo 'tis with many men, who, being brought off by the Lord from ſome preſſing calamity, they ſpeak good words, and carry it very well for a little time; but then they break out into the ſame exceſs of ſin and vanity, as ever; what a ſudden and ſtrange work was upon Iſrael, when God had ſet them upon drie land, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.31. yet <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> had ſcarcely finiſhed their <hi>Pſalme</hi> of praiſe, when Chap. 15.24. <hi>The people murmured, and ſpake high againſt God:</hi> O take heed of this ſpirit, leſt the Lord ſwear unto you in his wrath, as he did to Rebellious Iſrael, that you ſhall not enter his reſt; I ſhall ſhut up this Uſe with that <hi>Memento</hi> of the Apoſtle, <hi>Jude</hi> verſe 5. <hi>I will therefore put you in remembrance, how the Lord, having ſaved the people out of Egypt, afterward deſtroied them that believed not,</hi> that acted not up by faith, to thoſe mercies received; that improved not thoſe advantages of mercy and providential Adminiſtrations, which the Lord had put into their hands, in ſubſerviency to his glory, and
